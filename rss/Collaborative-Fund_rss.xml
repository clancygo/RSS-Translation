9月11日恐怖袭击发生后的第二天，国会议员站在美国国会大厦的台阶上&lt;a href =“ https://www.c-pan.org/clip/clip/news-conference/news-conference/user-conference/user-clip -Congress-wask-sings-sings-god-bles-bless-america-9-11-01/4816002“>;和sang &lt;/a>; &lt;em>;上帝保佑美国。&lt;/em>; &lt;/em>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您能想象今天发生？鉴于政治变得多么令人讨厌，很容易说不。但是，如果美国再次面临像9/11这样的生存危机，我认为您会看到同样的团结回归。 &lt;a href =“ https://collabfund.com/blog/common-enemies/”>;历史悠久的历史&lt;/a>;敌人在面对巨大的，破坏性的威胁时将他们的差异抛在一边。当狗屎变得真实时，人们会变得认真。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果这听起来像是一厢情愿，让我提出一个原因：当今世界如此琐碎和生气的部分原因是因为生活目前非常适合很多人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有家庭战争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失业率很低。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;家庭财富&lt;a href =“ https：//www.reuters 。 >; &lt;p>;创新令人惊讶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;它远非完美，甚至乐观主义者也可以列出数百个问题和不公正现象。一个悲观主义者会做得更糟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;，但让我这样说：随着世界的改善，我们抱怨掉落的门槛。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在没有大问题的情况下，人们会改变他们的烦恼给较小的。在没有小问题的情况下，他们专注于小问题甚至虚构的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大多数人 - 而且绝对是整个社会 - 似乎具有最小的压力。他们永远不会完全放心，因为解决了每个问题后，焦虑的目光都转移到下一个问题，无论相对于以前的问题多么微不足道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;都没有强调他们的下一顿饭会在哪里来自，担心转向政治家不礼貌。缓解战争的创伤，压力转向某人的语言是令人反感的，还是股市被高估。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;想象一个虚构的社会，具有无限的财富，无限的健康和永久的和平。他们会充满欢乐吗？可能不是。我认为他们的定义特征将是他们的不满和荒谬的。他们的女仆迟到了10分钟，他们会很生气，强调了他们的草坪是否足够绿色，或者沮丧的是他们的孩子没有进入哈佛。 a href =“ https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc8716590/”>;概念creep &lt;/a>;。这是问题的定义超出其原始边界的扩展。它通常给人的印象是，当我们改变的定义是一个问题时，世界正在越来越糟。它发生了两种方式：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;  - 先前认为正常的事情被重新定义为风险&lt;/strong>;。就像一个孩子在学校被欺负，或被诊断为精神疾病的轻度焦虑一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;  - 较少的风险实例不太严重，因为重大风险&lt;/strong>; &lt;/strong>;。就像必须延迟65岁至67岁的退休一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在每种情况下，世界都会变得更好，但人们感觉不到 - 他们甚至可以感觉自己倒退了 - 因为一旦一次问题被解决了它被新的替代，通常以相同的焦虑，恐惧和愤怒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我牢记的一些事情：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;方式，进步的最佳定义&lt;/strong>;是当您淘汰了主要问题并处理较低，重度的问题时。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;压力是创新者&lt;/strong &lt;/strong >;。没有什么像忧虑那样激励，所以我们永远不应该想要一个人们将一切都视为完美的世界。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;人们是解决问题的人&lt;/strong>;。这是一个很好的特征，也是所有进步的来源。但是，当解决问题是您身份的核心时，您偶尔会看到不存在的麻烦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;生气可能是一种令人陶醉的感觉&lt;/strong>;。它提供了一种道德上的优势感，因为当您指责他人引起问题时，您意味着自己比他们更好。感觉很棒，以一种奇怪的方式，有些人喜欢生气。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;意见分歧&lt;/strong>;，世界越好。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:26:00 -0500</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/minimum-levels-of-stress/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/minimum-levels-of-stress/</guid></item><item><title>我有几个问题</title><description>&lt;p>;它们与每个人都相关，并适用于很多事情：&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;美国刚刚结束了第60次总统大选，每个美国人都应该感谢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，在所有投票支持卡玛拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）的人都开始发怒之前&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现实是，每个美国人在每次选举后都应感恩，&lt;em>;不管结果如何。&lt;/em>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您听说过。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;em>;每次大选后，每个美国人都应感恩。实际上，每个美国人也应该感谢这些选举通常由剃须刀稀薄的边缘决定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;，因为这些选举突出了美国最伟大的超级能力之一 - 它的“选择性” 。 >; &lt;p>;美国的选择性源于以下事实：其公民有能力但没有义务每四年改变该国的方向。如果情况进展顺利，美国人可以选择“保持课程”。但是，如果他们认为占领白宫的政党朝一个方向摇摆得太远，他们可以投票通过另一个方向搬家。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不要误会我的意思。美国还有很多事情要做，包括在其沿海地区受到两个巨大的海洋的保护，其北部和南部的两个友好国家，庞大的资源（能源，农田和可通道的水道），一个多样化的人口，受过教育的劳动力和企业家精神，以及世界上最强大的军事，经济和金融市场。但是，美国人选择如何最有效利用这些资产的能力使它成为世界上最具活力的国家和经济。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么美国人应该感谢他们的选举由剃刀稀薄确定边缘，事实是，如果美国拥有一个主导的政党（即“一个党派”），那么实施变革将会更加困难。值得庆幸的是，美国摇摆人选民在最新选举中所证明的是该国的运作方式。 -11-26％20AT％201.36.21％E2％80％AFPM.PNG“ alt =”屏幕截图2024-11-26 at 1.36.21 pm.png“ />; &lt; />; &lt;

&lt;p>;结果？&lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿根廷从以每卡皮塔的GDP为基础来衡量的世界上世界上最富有的国家之一，到被通货膨胀袭击的国家（2023年在20％以北，超过100％以上），腐败，贫困（目前超过40％） ，还有一系列债务违约。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，这是怎么发生的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;发生了，因为阿根廷人失去了选择性。他们失去了建立改变的能力。塑造他们的命运。结果，一个人认为，一个国家将是下一个伟大的全球大国之一，而是遭受了历史性的下降。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;听起来我们今天正在目睹的事情很熟悉吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应该这样做，因为习近平删除了任期限制并在2018年灌输了自己的“终身总统”之后，中国人民被剥夺了他们的选择性（虽然中国人没有民主选举，但在XI之前的几年中，其领导人通常会响应需求/需求/ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样做，习惯似乎将中国置于与阿根廷类似的道路上，或者就此而言，俄罗斯，土耳其，伊朗和许多目前是一党或专制国家的中东国家。毫不奇怪，这些国家是腐败，不平衡的经济体以及与“西方”的差异。芬兰，荷兰，新西兰，挪威，瑞典，瑞士和英国也是最不腐败的，拥有最平衡和韧性的经济体，并且是美国最强大的盟友。毫不奇怪，这些国家历史上也拥有一些最强大的股票市场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有趣的是如何运作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实是，选择性是生活中最不被忽视的事物之一。这就是使您能够敏捷，更改过程，即时调整和自我校正的原因。这也使您能够度过困难的时刻，同时参加好人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然美国人可能会为国家的前进道路而战，有时会彼此恶化，要么在当彼此之间感到沮丧他们的候选人在获胜时输掉或激动，我们应该珍惜我们的选举，因为这意味着我们有能力（但不是义务）改变我们所处的道路。选择我们的命运。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与中国有关，只要缺乏可选性，消费者的信心就会保持沮丧（自XI删除任期限制以来已下跌了30％以上），净资本流出将继续，经济状况可能会进一步恶化，其股票市场将陷入困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;坦率地说，这就是使我现在对我感到不可投资的原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说，如果中国，恢复到一个期限限制的系统，情况可能会迅速而急剧发生变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毕竟，这正是去年在阿根廷当选自由主义者麦片后在阿根廷发生的事情。 The results so far have been astounding as Argentina has experienced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/453-javier-milei-president-of-argentina-freedom/id1434243584?i=1000677651141 “>;通货膨胀的物质下降，经济增长的绿色拍摄以及由于他的彻底变化而导致的世界领先股权&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在我的脑海中，我回头想：“那时我一定很高兴。那是我最好的时光。”但实际上，当时，我在想：“我等不及要结束了。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;俄语对怀旧的说法：“过去比未来更加不可预测。”人们对当时与他们当时的实际感受脱节的时间的记忆是如此普遍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我有一个理论，为什么会发生这种情况：研究历史时，您知道故事是如何结束的，这使得这是如此人们无法想象人们过去的想法或感觉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在思考自己的生活时，我们不记得过去的实际感觉。我们还记得我们认为我们应该感觉到的，鉴于我们今天所知道的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我记得自己比我更快乐，因为今天，回头看，我知道我担心的大多数事情从未担心发生了。我没有被解雇，事业状况良好，关系持续了下来。 i &lt;a href =“ https://collabfund.com/blog/overcoming-your-demons/”>;杀死了一些恶魔&lt;/a>;。即使是很难又不喜欢我想要的事情，我已经过了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我现在知道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;，但当时我不知道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以当我回头看时，我看到一个没有什么可担心的孩子。即使当时，我所做的就是担心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;，当您知道故事结局时，很难记住您的感受。&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;p>;我最近被问到了我在一次会议上，投资者对股票市场的看法基本上是在过去的15年中直接上升的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的第一个想法是：您是对的。如果您在15年前开始投资并首次检查您的帐户，那么您会喘着粗气。您已经发了大财。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后我想，等一下。 &lt;em>;在过去的15年中直截了当吗？&lt;/em>;回应我的妻子：您在说什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们要假装2011年夏天的22％崩溃从未发生？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们应该忘记股票在2016年跌幅超过20％，在2018年再次跌落？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们是 -  &lt;em>;你好？&lt;/em>;  - 现在假装自2020年大萧条以来没有发生的最严重的经济灾难？美国的国债被降级了吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们现在是否忘记了，在过去15年的几乎每一刻，聪明的人都认为市场被高估了，经济衰退已经接近，过度通货膨胀就在拐角处，该国是破产，数字被操纵，美元一时毫无价值？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为我们忘记了这些事情，因为我们现在知道故事的结局：股市上涨了很多。如果您紧紧抓住，那么过去的事件都不重要。因此，很容易打折 - 甚至忽略 - 当时的感觉。您回想起说：“这是如此简单，钱是免费的，市场直接上升。”即使在过去的15年中很少有人真正感觉到这种方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投资中重要的很多 - 对于生活中的许多事情来说都是如此 - 您如何管理不确定性的心理学。回顾事后看来的问题是，没有什么不确定的。您认为没有人有什么可担心的，因为他们担心的大多数最终都会过去。过去的自我。但是您过去的自我不知道事情会在哪里。不确定性在当前几乎决定了一切，但是回头看，我们假装它从未存在。&lt; /p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;我和我的妻子最近买了一所新房子。像全国大多数地区一样，它花费了 - 让我轻微地把它放在几年前。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们开始谈论2009年的廉价房屋。在我们地区，他们实际上是今天的成本是当时的四到五倍 - 此外，2009年的利率低，市场上有无穷无尽的房屋可供选择。我们说了一些措施：“那时人们很幸运。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后我们抓住了自己，摆脱了妄想，思考：“等等，我们真的对经济有害2009 &lt;/em>;？”从字面上看，这是80年来最糟糕的经济体。所有人都说的只是一切都多么可怕。房屋便宜，因为失业率为10％，股市下跌了50％。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回顾过去，我们知道2009年不仅是最底层，而且是新繁荣的开始（尽管有波动性）。但是那时我们还不知道这一点，这让我们很担心今天很容易忘记。那感觉就像风险现在看起来像是机会。当时感觉就像是冒险。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以类似的方式，美国人仍然对1950年代的生活怀有怀旧之情。白色纠察围栏，中产阶级繁荣，幸福的家庭，蓬勃发展的经济。也存在核歼灭的不断存在的风险。今天，我们知道该导弹从未发射过。但是，五年级学生通过躲在学校桌子下来进行核攻击训练吗？她不知道，因为我们知道故事是如何结束的，因此今天不必担心这是不可能的。因此，当然她不像我们认为她应该过的那样快乐。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我订阅了一些专门针对1990年代怀旧的Instagram帐户。那时我还是个孩子，所以我是这个东西的傻瓜。对这些帖子的评论不可避免地说：“那是最好的岁月。 90年代末和2000年代初是生命的最佳时机。”也许很好。但是我们也遇到了：2001年的一次衰退，一次有争议的总统大选，9-11  - 完全重塑文化 - 两次战争，不断地进行经济复苏缓慢。很容易忘记所有这些，因为我们知道经济恢复，战争结束了，没有另一个重大的恐怖袭击。事后看来，一切看起来都可以肯定，但是当时不确定性排除了一天。&lt; /p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;当然，情况可能会有所不同。对于许多人来说 - 那些被解雇的人，或者&lt;em>; &lt;/em>; &lt;/em>; &lt;/em>; &lt;/em>; &lt;em>;在战争中死了 - 回忆什么幸福的怀旧之情生活就像以前一样有效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;，但正如托马斯·杰斐逊（Thomas Jefferson）所说：“造成了从未发生过的邪恶使我们造成了多少痛苦。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怀旧的部分原因是是因为，知道我们今天的工作，我们经常回顾过去，并说：“您真的没有太多有什么需要的。”您适应并继续前进。这不是我们展望未来的重要教训吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;理解为什么经济怀旧是如此强大 - 为什么几乎不可能记住过去的不确定事物在您知道故事的结局时有多不确定 - 有助于解释 - 解释我认为是经济史上最重要的一课，大多数时候对大多数人来说都是如此：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去并不像您记得的那样好。现在不如您想象的那么糟糕。未来将比您预期的要好。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Oct 2024 18:28:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-message-from-the-past-thoughts-on-nostalgia/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-message-from-the-past-thoughts-on-nostalgia/</guid></item><item><title>按照自己的方式做</title><description>&lt;p>;最终的成功指标是您是否从人生中获得了想要的东西。但这比听起来很难，因为很容易尝试复制想要您不想要的东西的人。&lt;

&lt;p>;即使您不是企业家，也有很多东西可以从中学到很多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一方面认识到人们之间有多少种类（不同的个性，背景，目标，技能）是如此普遍，但另一方面，“做这件事的最佳方法是什么？”好像对截然不同的人可能会有一个通用的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个领域，这会影响人们的金钱，而更多的损害不是由愚蠢的财务计划造成的，而是由合理的损害造成的。您。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毫无用处。更重要的是，每个人都没有教他的儿子骑自行车最重要的部分 - 学习如何平衡。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑一下。当训练轮或三轮车可能稳定骑手时，也不允许孩子在自行车上均衡自己的体重。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原因？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;额外的车轮可以实现所有平衡。他们只是用作拐杖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，麦克法兰做了什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他决定设计一种非常不同的自行车，而是在自行车上添加一些东西，而是&lt;em>; &lt;em>;他选择拿走一些东西&lt;/em>;  - 在这种情况下，踏板。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结果是&lt;a href =“ https://striderbikes.com/”>; strider自行车&lt;/a>;，这使孩子们能够专注于他们的平衡，此后成为有史以来最畅销的自行车之一，也是各地父母的天赐之物。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这个故事远非唯一的情况，最好的解决方案来自&lt;em>; &lt;em>;使用少的东西而不是更多&lt;/em>;。实际上，在过去的两年中，我亲自处理了这种动态。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看，我小时候就与湿疹长大了，我很幸运地超过了八岁的时候。不幸的是，它早在2021年初就重新出现了，所以我去看了许多医生，皮肤科医生和过敏症分子。每个人都建议一种新的奶油，药丸，并最终拍摄，从而导致结果非常好。最终，它使我意识到过敏症患者进行贴片测试，这实质上是一种测试，以查看您是否对各种肥皂，洗发剂，乳霜和无数其他产品中通常发现的任何特定化学物质过敏。我参加了测试，发现我对他们测试的150件事中的两件事非常过敏，其中一件在称为Aquaphor的东西中很普遍，这是我们一直在使用的类似Vaseline的药膏&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;事实是，人们倾向于通过加法而不是减法解决问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原因？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为添加一些东西会让您觉得自己正在前进，同时带走了一些东西会让您觉得自己正在退缩。将这与大多数公司都被激励向我们出售无尽的“解决方案”的事实，这不足为奇的是，渴望将某些东西带走实际上是不存在的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们看到了所有人的这种动态在医疗保健中，经济的一部分以及整个社会。有皮肤问题吗？尝试这种奶油。难以入睡吗？服用这个药。不能减肥？以这种名为Ozempic的新型注射剂（具有讽刺意味的是，一种旨在 *取消 *我们的食欲的药物）。凯西（Casey）的意思是在她的新书中广泛写这篇文章 -  &lt;a href =“ https://www.amazon.com/good-energy-sorprising-connection-connection-connection-metabolism/dp/0593712641”>;好&lt;/a>;现在在亚马逊图表上＃1。 In short, she makes the case that instead of jumping immediately to medications that almost always have side effects, we should instead start by identifying what is causing the problem and trying to eliminate it. For example, if you have a skin issue, start by cutting out soaps with countless active ingredients.不能睡觉？ Cut back the amount of alcohol you drink and/or TV you watch before bed.

Try reducing the amount of processed food and sugar you eat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In software, this concept of favoring less over more is known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot;>;Mythical Man Month&lt;/a>;” (or more simply, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law&quot;>;Brooks&#39; Law&lt;/a>;”), which was discussed at length on a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/invest-like-the-best-with-patrick-oshaughnessy/id1154105909?i=1000668134453&quot;>;podcast&lt;/a>; Patrick O&#39;Shaughnessy did with Bret Taylor (Co-Founder of Sierra, former Co-CEO of Salesforce, and a current board member at Open AI). Taylor pointed out that,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“If you want to make a software project take longer, add more people to it. This is based on the premise that when you are developing a complex system, smaller teams who complete each others&#39; sentences, each own part of the system, truly understand it, and work in unison create a magical, yet fragile, dynamic. This is the case because adding more people means more bureaucracy, which risks disempowering some of your best people and slowing things down. Just look at Healthcare.gov as a perfect example.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retail is another obvious example. Look no further than Starbucks&#39; recent troubles. One of the main culprits? The decision to add countless options to their mobile app. In short, by designing its app to enable customers to hyper-customize their favorite drinks (according to one report there are over 170,000 ways to customize a Starbucks order), it led to orders like the one below:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-09-18%20at%2010.56.07%E2%80%AFAM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 10.56.07 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead of increasing revenues and customer retention, this hyper customization led to poor customer service, employee turnover, longer wait times, and often incorrect drink orders. Eventually, it even led to Starbucks firing its CEO and replacing him with Brian Niccol, who made a name for himself running a company that has nearly perfected the concept of “taking things away” — Chipotle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, by having far fewer options and ingredients, Chipotle created a juggernaut in the fast casual category by maximizing efficiency, throughput, and quality, which is a &lt;em>;very&lt;/em>; different business model than a company like McDonalds, which has an endless number of options on its menu and is constantly adding new ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, last year Chipotle&#39;s restaurants collectively generated more than $10 billion in annual revenues and close to $2 billion in annual operating profits (up from $900 million and $250 million respectively fifteen years ago). This model has resulted in a stock that has compounded at more than 25% annually over the past decade-and-a-half, which means that $1,000 invested in 2009 would be worth more than $40,000 today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, too many investors manage their portfolios like McDonalds or Starbucks instead of Chipotle. In an attempt to improve or upgrade them, they almost &lt;em>;always&lt;/em>; look to layer on new investments, commitments, asset classes, and securities, often shooting well past an appropriate level of complexity:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Worried about a market crash? Layer on expensive hedges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concerned about volatility? Buy complicated options.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Want to generate higher returns in a low interest rate environment? Add leverage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trying to keep up with other investors? Chase a hot buyout or venture capital fund.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trouble is that when they do this, the more vulnerable their portfolios become. It causes them to lose track of what they own, reduces their portfolio&#39;s liquidity &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; transparency, and forces them to pay higher fees in the process. It also often leads to investors being forced to make decisions they swore they never would, typically at the worst possible moments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We saw this first hand in the lead up to, and during, the Covid crazed market of 2020-2021. “One man band” venture capitalists were able to raise money with ease, firms like Tiger Global sprayed money in every direction with little diligence, term sheets from unknown investors landed on general partners&#39; desks, “extension funds” were waved into portfolios without even the slightest objection from limited partners, leverage was easy to come by, and investors happily traded daily liquidity for decade liquidity. Yet this is just the tip of the iceberg, as there were countless other examples of investments and structures being added to portfolios in pursuit of higher returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 2022 and 2023, this dynamic changed materially as “one man VCs” started to disappear, the Tigers of the world were humbled and retrenched, those blind term sheets stopped coming, extension funds were tabled, limited partners starting guarding liquidity with their lives, and investors more broadly started pulling in the reins as they attempted to determine what lay ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, experiences like this beg a few questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is increased complexity the path to better performance, or would investors be better off if they simply removed a few things?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should investors hold one hundred 1% positions in their portfolio (ie, be overly diversified), or should they concentrate their bets in their highest conviction positions, watch them closely, and add to them when they get dislocated?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should investors deploy capital at a torrid pace during bull markets, or would they benefit from slowing down a bit?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer in each case is very likely an emphatic “yes” to the latter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this probably goes for most things in life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about it this way. What would happen if you reduced the number of things you focus on in your daily life by 20%? How about 30%?? Say 50%???&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the chances you wouldn&#39;t miss the things you cut out?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Would you possibly become more focused on the things you decided to keep?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Would you end up being a happier person? A better colleague?父母？ Spouse?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My guess is the answer would be a “yes” across the board here too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you might say, my life or portfolio is already &lt;em>;SO&lt;/em>; complicated, how can I possibly uncomplicate it?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My response?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just because things have gotten complicated doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t reverse it. Afterall, if Elon Musk can do it with his Raptor rocket engines, you can too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-09-18%20at%2010.56.37%E2%80%AFAM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 10.56.37 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this day and age the case can be made that we live in an era of too much. Too much information, too much stuff, too many choices, and too many distractions. As a result, there is a good chance that the path to happier lives, and yes, better portfolio performance, might start by taking things away.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:52:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/take-something-away/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/take-something-away/</guid></item><item><title> Podcast With Howard Marks</title><description> &lt;p>;I recently sat down with legendary investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We talked about investing, debt, endurance, and what really makes a difference in lifetime investment results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can check it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/behind-the-memo-the-impact-of-debt-with/id1521551570?i=1000666742345&quot;>;Apple&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ewk6BeHzcHadH5vfJvZSy&quot;>;Spotify&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea3shooJW0o&quot;>;YouTube&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Sep 2024 10:11:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/podcast-with-howard-marks/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/podcast-with-howard-marks/</guid></item><item><title> Cumulative vs. Cyclical Knowledge</title><description> &lt;p>;President James Garfield died because the best doctors in the country didn&#39;t believe in germs, probing Garfield&#39;s bullet wound after an assassination attempt with ungloved, unwashed fingers that almost certainly contributed to his fatal infection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It sounds crazy – 1881 wasn&#39;t &lt;em>;that&lt;/em>; long ago – but historian Candice Millard writes in her book &lt;em>;Destiny of the Republic&lt;/em>; how controversial germ theory was to 19th-century doctors:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;They found the notion of “invisible germs” to be ridiculous, and they refused to even consider the idea that they could be the cause of so much disease and death.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the editor of the highly respected Medical Record found more to fear than to admire in [antiseptic pioneer] Lister&#39;s theory. “Judging the future by the past,” he wrote, “we are likely to be as much ridiculed in the next century for our blind belief in the power of unseen germs as our forefathers were for their faith in the influence of spirits.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only did many American doctors not believe in germs, they took pride in the particular brand of filth that defined their profession.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They spoke fondly of the “good old surgical stink” that pervaded their hospitals and operating rooms, and they resisted making too many concessions even to basic hygiene … They believed that the thicker the layers of dried blood and pus, black and crumbling as they bent over their patients, the greater the tribute to their years of experience … They preferred, moreover, to rely on their own methods of treatment, which not infrequently involved applying a hot poultice of cow manure to an open wound.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Even a child reading this today recognizes how insane this is. And it&#39;s hardly an isolated example. Doctors used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)88719-0/fulltext&quot;>;prescribe chloroform&lt;/a>; for asthma and cigarettes for hay fever 。 They &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigthink.com/health/milk-transfusion/&quot;>;injected cow&#39;s milk&lt;/a>; into the veins of tuberculosis patients, hoping the fat would transform into white blood cells.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mercifully, we&#39;ve moved on. We believe new crazy stuff, but not &lt;em>;that&lt;/em>; crazy stuff. Everyone learned, those learnings were universally accepted and passed down the generations who are now better off because of it. Reading about medicine from 100 years ago makes you feel utterly disconnected from today&#39;s world, like you&#39;re reading about a different topic altogether.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But take something like money.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These lines were written 130 years ago by author William Dawson:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;It would seem that the anxieties of getting money only beget the more torturing anxiety of how to keep it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More lives have been spoiled by competence than by poverty; indeed, I doubt whether poverty has any effect at all upon a strong character, except as a stimulus to exertion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The thing that is least perceived about wealth is that all pleasure in money ends at the point where economy becomes unnecessary. The man who can buy anything he covets values nothing that he buys.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this, written by Earnest Hemingway in 1936:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;He remembered poor Scott Fitzgerald and his romantic awe of [the rich] … He thought they were a special glamorous race and when he found they weren&#39;t it wrecked him as much as any other thing that wrecked him.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this, written by a lawyer in 1934, taking account of the bubble preceding the Great Depression:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;In normal times the average professional man makes just a living and lives up to the limit of his income because he must dress well, etc. In times of depression he not only fails to make a living but has no surplus capital to buy bargains in stocks and real estate. I see now how very important it is for the professional man to build up a surplus in normal times. Without it he is at the mercy of the economic winds.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this, describing the 1920s Florida real estate:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;From 1919 to 1929, both forms of personal debt—mortgages and installment credit—soared. The volume of home mortgages more than tripled, and the amount of outstanding installment debt more than doubled.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/27/seneca-fat-cat-philosopher-emily-wilson-a-life&quot;>;account&lt;/a>; of Seneca, who lived 2,000 years ago:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Enemies accused him of preying on affluent elderly people in the hope of being remembered in their wills, and of “sucking the provinces dry” by lending money at a steep rate of interest to those in the distant parts of the empire.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s all so relatable. Like nothing has changed. We&#39;ve always been asking the same questions, dealing with the same problems, and falling for the same false solutions. We probably always will.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading old finance articles makes you feel like the ancient past was no different than today – the opposite feeling you get reading old medical commentary.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course there are things we knew about medicine 200 years ago that were true and things we believed about money 100 years ago that were false. But in degree there is no comparison – there&#39;s no financial equivalent of everyone denying germs only to eventually agree that it&#39;s so obviously true it&#39;s not worth debating.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some fields our knowledge is seamlessly passed down across generations. In others, it&#39;s fleeting. To paraphrase investor Jim Grant: Knowledge in some fields is cumulative. In other fields it&#39;s cyclical (at best).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are occasional periods when society learns that debt can be dangerous, greed backfires, and more money won&#39;t solve all your problems. But it quickly forgets and moves on.一次又一次。 Generation after generation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think there are a few reasons this happens, and what it means we have to accept.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Some fields have quantifiable truths, while others are guided by vague beliefs and individual circumstances&lt;/strong>;. Physicist Richard Feynman said, “Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.” Well, people do. So any topic guided by behavior – money, philosophy, relationships, etc. – can&#39;t be solved with a formula like physics and math.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Neil deGrasse Tyson says, “The good thing about science is that it&#39;s true whether or not you believe in it.” You can disagree and say science is the practice of continuous exploration and changing your mind, but in general he&#39;s right. Germ theory is true and we know it&#39;s true. But what about the proper level of savings and spending to live a good life? Or how much risk to take? Or the right investing strategy given today&#39;s economy? Those kinds of questions do not lend themselves to scientific answers. They&#39;re subjective, nuanced, and impacted by how the economy changes over time. So often there simply isn&#39;t relevant information to pass down to the next generations. Even when firm financial rules exist, some truths have to be experienced firsthand to be understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Cyclical knowledge, and the inability to fully learn from others&#39; past experiences, means you have to accept a level of volatility and fragility not found in other fields&lt;/strong>;. I can imagine a world in 50 years where things like cancer and heart disease are either non-existent or effectively controlled. I cannot ever imagine a world where economic volatility is tamed and people stop making financial decisions they eventually regret – no matter how much history of past mistakes we have to study.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Aug 2024 16:55:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/cumulative-vs-cyclical-knowledge/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/cumulative-vs-cyclical-knowledge/</guid></item><item><title> A Number From Today and A Story About Tomorrow</title><description> &lt;p>;Every forecast takes a number from today and multiplies it by a story about tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investment valuations, economic outlooks, political forecasts – they all follow that formula. Something we know multiplied by a story we like.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trick when forecasting is realizing that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few weeks before he died a reporter asked Franklin Roosevelt if the Yalta Conference negotiations near the end of World War II set the stage for permanent peace in Europe.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I can answer that question if you can tell me who your descendants will be in the year 2057,” Roosevelt said 。 “We can look as far ahead as humanity believes in this sort of thing.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The deals hammered out in Yalta were the things we knew. How long they&#39;d hold, how much they&#39;d be adhered to, and what else could get in their way is just a story people told and believed in varying degrees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anything that tries to forecast what people will do next work like that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hard thing is that while the number we know today can be something real and verified, the story we multiply it by is driven by what you want to believe will happen or &lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/story/&quot;>;what makes the most sense&lt;/a>;. Forecasters get into trouble when &lt;em>;the number we know from today&lt;/em>; gives an impression that you&#39;re being objective and data-driven when &lt;em>;the story about tomorrow&lt;/em>; is so subject to opinion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When valuing a company, revenue/cash flow/profits is the number we know. The earnings multiple you attach to that figure is just a story about future growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Same with economic trends. We have lots of data, but none of it means much until you attach a story to it about what you think it means and what you think people will do with it next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That seems obvious to me. But ask forecasters if they think the majority of what they do is storytelling and you&#39;ll get blank stares.充其量。 It never seems like storytelling when you&#39;re basing a forecast in data.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And while data-driven storytelling doesn&#39;t mean guessing, it doesn&#39;t mean prophecy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We can use historical data to assume a trend will continue, but that&#39;s just a story we want to believe in a world where &lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/what-always-changes/&quot;>;things change&lt;/a>; all the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We can use data to assume a crazy event will revert to the norm, but that&#39;s also just a story in a world where unsustainable &lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/five-lessons-from-history/&quot;>;trends last longer&lt;/a>; than people think.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Few things escape that reality. BH Liddell Hart writes in the book &lt;em>;Why Don&#39;t We Learn From History?&lt;/em>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;In finance this point is made with the quip that more fiction has been written in Excel than in Word.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of this is bad. I think it&#39;s just realistic, and it means all of us should keep a few things in mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. A fact multiplied by a story always equals something less than a fact.&lt;/strong>; So almost all predictions have less than a 100% chance of coming true. That&#39;s not a bold statement, but if you embrace it it always pushes you towards room for error and the ability to endure surprise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. The most persuasive stories are what you want to believe are true or are an extension of what you&#39;ve experienced firsthand&lt;/strong>;, which is what makes forecasting so hard.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. If you&#39;re trying to figure out where something is going next, you have to understand more than its technical possibilities&lt;/strong>;. You have to understand the stories everyone tells themselves about those possibilities, because it&#39;s such a big part of the forecasting equation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4. When interest rates are low, the story side of the equation becomes more powerful&lt;/strong>;. When short-term results aren&#39;t competing for attention with interest rates, most of a company&#39;s valuation comes from what it might be able to achieve in the future. That, of course, is just a story. And people can come up with some wild stories.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 20 Aug 2024 15:40:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/numbersandstories/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/numbersandstories/</guid></item><item><title> A Few Little Ideas And Short Stories</title><description> &lt;p>;I once asked a successful author how to market a book.

How can you hate them? But he kept hearing it over and over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Asked where the animosity came from, the vets kept talking about the donuts. The donuts, the donuts, the donuts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During World War II the Red Cross set up comfort stations across Europe for Allied soldiers to get a haircut, coffee, and donuts. It was free for the Americans, but British and Canadian soldiers were charged a few cents. That created a hierarchy that hurt morale, so American generals eventually asked the Red Cross to start charging the American soldiers too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly US troops – accustomed to getting free donuts – were being charged. And they hated it, viewing the Red Cross as a greedy profiteer exploiting their hunger. The grudge remained for decades after the war.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two lessons here: It&#39;s almost impossible to charge for something once you&#39;ve given it away for free, so choose your business model carefully. And people are extremely sensitive to even reasonable price changes, which is why inflation is always an emotional issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Jerry Seinfeld &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/jerry-seinfeld-gq-hype&quot;>;recently said&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Audiences are now flocking to stand-up because it&#39;s something you can&#39;t fake.

That&#39;s a good, balanced, routine. It&#39;s when you know you&#39;re pushing yourself, but not too hard. Taking risks, but not overdoing it. Have challenging goals, but not unrealistic ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think you can apply that to businesses, careers, and relationships: If it&#39;s always terrible, you&#39;re doing it wrong.

The same is true for so many things in life: The unsexy work, where there&#39;s little competition, is where some of the biggest ideas are found.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;A startup founder I know was once trying to raise money from an investor.

This is troubling because when people can&#39;t find the truth, they don&#39;t know where to turn. They don&#39;t know how to respond. They don&#39;t know where to look for guidance. As a result, they wander aimlessly searching for it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet, the good news is that when people eventually find the truth, they immediately know it because, as Winston Churchill said, “The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it and ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have thought about this a lot in recent weeks and, in doing so, was reminded of a lesson my father imparted on me and my brother when we were kids. We commonly referred to it as “filling the bathtub”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My most vivid memory of this lesson came after one of us lost something that was important to him. When he got home from work, he was clearly disappointed, so he sat us down and said,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;“Alright boys. Imagine you have an empty bathtub and an eyedropper filled with water. How long do you think it would take to fill that bathtub if you added one drop at a time?”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confused, and likely a bit scared, we replied,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;“Uhhh…a long time?”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My dad replied,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;“That&#39;s right. A long, LONG time, but if you have enough time, you will eventually fill that tub.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two of us nodded in agreement as he continued,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;“The same goes for trust. Each time you two do something trustworthy, you get to add a drop. Over time, those tiny drops accumulate until the bathtub is full. And, when the bathtub is full, you will have earned my trust.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remember thinking to myself,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&lt;em>;Got it dad. Makes sense&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But he wasn&#39;t finished. His lesson had another leg to it,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;“However, boys…when you do something that is significantly untrustworthy, you pull the plug and all that water you&#39;ve earned over time goes down the drain .”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This image has stuck with me, especially today given how hard it seems to know who or what to trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, this raises two questions — Why is this the case and what can we do about it?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I found it helpful to turn to a few quotes from the late Charlie Munger who, alongside Warren Buffett, managed Berkshire Hathaway for close to six decades and, in doing so, earned the trust of countless people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;“Show me the incentives and I will show you the outcome.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While technology has materially decreased the time it takes do many things (ie, book reservations, send messages, check the weather, get directions, etc.), it has also &lt;em>;increased&lt;/em>; peoples&#39; desire for直接结果。 As a result, this has significantly altered the incentives that drive the economy, and society at large.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look no further than people on social media clamoring for “likes”, politicians catering to their bases instead of “crossing the aisle” to appeal to voters in the middle, the media thriving on soundbites and scandals as opposed to simply reporting the news, and investors making extremely confident forecasts instead of acknowledging an uncertain future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, where does this leave us?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While this behavior can generate their desired results (ie, often money and fame), it typically entails stretching the truth. Even more troubling, sustaining these results often requires consistently “one upping” yourself, which means stretching the truth even further.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think of it this way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To increase their “likes”, an “influencer” on social media must paint a picture of an even better life (ie, more airbrushed photos, exotic vacations, fancy cars, private jets, etc.).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To get more attention, a politician must move their stances even further to the extremes (ie, think about who gets on MSNBC and Fox News most often…it is not the boring centrists).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To get more viewers, MSNBC and Fox News have to do the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To entice limited partners to invest in a company, deal, or fund with a payoff well into the future, not only does management have to make bold forecasts that increase expectations regarding how large the opportunity is, they have to then &lt;em>;exceed&lt;/em>; these forecasts over time (often by a considerable amount).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trouble is that when the truth gets stretched far enough, something eventually breaks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, influencers have resorted to doing more extreme things for attention, political disfunction has reached a nadir, the media sensationalizes the news at best (or flat out makes it up at worst), and many companies that hyped their “massive total addressable markets” rose quickly to dramatic heights, only to fall in spectacular fashion (see Robinhood, WeWork, Peloton, and FTX, just to name a few).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, it shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone that confidence across countless parts of society has fallen to levels not seen in decades.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-07-25%20at%2010.32.35%E2%80%AFAM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 10.32.35 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That is just a glimpse of how we got here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How about where we&#39;re going?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;“The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily”&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like a tree that spends many years as a small sapling before growing into a towering oak, trust&#39;s earliest drops are negligible and barely visible. Yet, over time they compound on one another as trust increases. It just takes a lot of patience and persistence to wait for that tub to fill up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-07-25%20at%2010.32.40%E2%80%AFAM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 10.32.40 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Herein lies the opportunity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this empty tub of a world we seem to be living in, several paths forward will likely emerge for those interested in seeking the truth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three stand out:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is likely the easiest — to accept and live with the status quo. Those who choose this path will argue, “Sure, the bathtub is empty, but this is just the world we live in” and “Given that it is harder than ever to determine who and what we can trust, why waste the effort trying?透明While this is not the path I would suggesting taking, I can&#39;t blame those who do. Afterall, seeking the truth today is exhausting, and potentially damaging if you accidentally hitch yourself to the wrong wagon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is more difficult, but will likely be the most promoted path. It will center around developing and leveraging technologies like artificial intelligence that attempt to “find the truth”. To “fact check” and “validate”. These technologies will likely aim to help people counter those that spread “untruths”. While this path will be tempting, it will only be a shortcut, which as Morgan Housel describes in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/investing-the-greatest-show-on-earth/&quot;>;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/a>;”, is not sustainable. Think of it as a more robust version of X&#39;s “community notes”.有帮助吗？当然。 A durable way to determine and build trust? Unlikely.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then there is a third option. The good old-fashioned way — seeking out, following, partnering with, and investing in those who are committed to filling the bathtub gradually. This path requires identifying those who repeatedly do the right thing. These are the people willing to resist this new incentive structure centered around shorter attention spans and instantaneous feedback. These are the companies and investors who favor long-term compounding and are committed to staying the course, even if it means enduring periods that test even the most determined souls.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surely this will require time and patience, but it will be worth it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t believe me?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look no further than Munger&#39;s philosophy on hiring,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;“It is simple…trust first, ability second.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger elaborated,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“Warren and I have a system where we spend a lot of time identifying very trustworthy people and then pass along that trust. As they practice that trust, they get more confirmed in being trustworthy. Eventually this creates a seamless web of trust, which is incredibly efficient and useful. By the way, this isn&#39;t just my doctrine, there is the doctrine in economics that tries to explain why firms come into existence and it states that &#39;firms come into existence because a lot of people who trust one another operating within a firm are more efficient than they would be if they were a bunch of independent proprietors&#39;.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In essence, Munger is describing his own version of the bathtub. By creating a “seamless web” of people he and Buffett could trust, and then empowering them, the duo created a unique compounding machine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This created significant advantages — like being able to buy companies more cheaply because sellers were willing to accept a lower price in exchange for retaining more control. Then, given management teams had Buffett and Munger&#39;s trust, they could operate their companies with more freedom, which enabled them to make better long-term decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, Berkshire built an incredibly loyal shareholder base, an even larger and loyal collection of admirers, and one of the strongest long-term performance track records of all-time (~20% compounded since 1965) despite enduring multiple material downturns, difficult moments (see their original investment in Berkshire Hathaway in the early 1960&#39;s and then in Salomon Brothers in the early 1990&#39;s), and prolonged periods of relative underperformance (Berkshire trailed the NASDAQ by more than 30% annually from 1995-1999).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, it feels like we are reaching an inflection point. I could be wrong, but it feels like people are tired of being lied to. Instead of airbrushed versions of life, they want to witness reality. They want politicians who tell it straight. They want a media that reports all sides of a story. They want to invest in companies and funds that are transparent, forthright, and aim to be around for decades instead of days. They want all the facts. They simply want the truth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, they want people willing to fill the tub.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 25 Jul 2024 13:32:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/fill-the-bathtub/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/fill-the-bathtub/</guid></item></channel></rss>
