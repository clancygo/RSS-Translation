&lt;p>;最华丽的公司并不总是为早期投资者带来最高的回报。让我们探讨两个截然不同的业务之间的比较：OpenAI和Olipop。它迎来了LLM的黄金时代，具有惊人的连锁效果：&lt;a href =“ https://www.forbes.com/sites/sites/bethkindig/2024/11/11/14/ai-spending-pending-pendend-pending-pendend-pendend-to-pending-pending-spending-to--exceed--exceed-a-exceed-a- a- ferter -trillion-next年/“>;技术巨头中与AI相关的资本支出飞涨&lt;/a>;，Nvidia的上升&lt;a href =” -apple-as-as-worlds最有价值的 - 易货公司 -  .html“>;世界上最有价值的公司&lt;/a>;按市场上限（尽管现在排名第3）和a &lt;a href =” https：// erviritionAmerica。 org/center/articles/fieeder-form-from-us-us-us-centers-centers-ty-by-by-2035-TheThats-like-Adding-Anhoth-California/＃：〜：〜：text = save％20％ 20bees-，电力％20按％20 from％20U.S.％20DATA％20centers％20could％20 More％20次20点20点20 double，复杂％20％20％20Clean％20 Energy％20 Transition。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那是一家苏打水公司的Olipop。但不只是苏打水。 Olipop可以通过对肠道友好的益生元和植物纤维进行更健康的替代方法。它的怀旧口味，例如经典的生啤酒和老式的可乐，令人放纵，但体验了。也很美味。很简单。方法论“>;比较方法论&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;要比较OpenAI和Olipop的第一位投资者的投资绩效，我们将使用简单的回报倍数：其所有权的当前价值除以其初始投资。由于两家公司在2019年提出了第一轮比赛，因此这种方法可以进行直接比较，尽管它并不能考虑时间安排（例如，IRR）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为简单起见，我们假设早期的投资者没有参加在后来的回合中被稀释。要计算这些回报，我们需要确定：&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;每个公司初始权益回合的尺寸和估值&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;随后回合的尺寸和估值以解释稀释&lt;/li>; &lt;/li>; &lt;li>;合理估计其当前估值&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;在退出之前可能会面临的未来稀释的预测&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3 id =“ OpenAis-Returns”>; OpenAI的回报&lt;/ H3>; &lt;p>;成立于2015年的非营利组织，致力于安全地推进AI，OpenAI于2019年进行了重组，以资助其昂贵的AGI追求。它创建了&lt;a href =“ https://openai.com/index/openai-lp/”>; Openai lp &lt;/a>;，由原始非营利组织（重命名的OpenAI非营利组织）管理的“限制 - 企业”实体。这种结构使Openai在限制早期投资者的回报率为100倍的同时筹集了私人资本，任何超额利润都流回了非营利组织。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此变化时，OpenAI也宣布了其&lt;a href =“ https” ：//openai.com/index/openai-lp/“>;首先由Khosla Ventures领导的机构资金巡回赛&lt;/a>;。让我们称之为他们的系列A。细节尚不清楚：PitchBook将其列为1000万美元的提高估值，而其他&lt;a href =” https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news/vinod-khosla-details-much -genture-134826473.html“>;来源&lt;/a>;建议仅Khosla的股份仅为5000万美元，售后估值为1B美元。我们将假设5％的所有权的圆形尺寸为5000万美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;估计稀释是棘手的。 OpenAi的大部分资金邮政系列A都来自Microsoft，它涌入了&lt;a href =“ https://www.wsj.com/tech/tech/tech/the/the-14-billion--billion--question-dividing-dividing-pividing-openai-andai-andai-and-and-and----------------------------------- Microsoft-71CF7D37“>;〜$ 14B，通过权益，Azure Credits &lt;/a>;和唯一&lt;a href =” OpenAIS-Profit-After Investing 10亿美元/“>;获利共享协议&lt;/a>;。消息人士在详细信息上不同意，但报告的投资包括2021年的$ 2B和2023年的10B美元。除了复杂性外，OpenAI现在正在过渡到营利性&lt;a a href =“ https://www.vox.com/ Future-Perfect/380117/Openai-Microsoft-Sam-Sam-Altman-Altman-Nononprofit-for-profit-for-for-for-for-foundation-fundation-farmater-Intelligence&#39;>;公共福利公司&lt;/a>;，可以消除早期投资者的回报100倍的上限。&lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要简化，我们假设：&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>; OpenAi完成了其过渡，删除了100倍的盖帽。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>; Microsoft 2021和2023 Investments的一半是稀释的，有估值2021年的$ 14B和2023年的$ 29B（如所建议的&lt;a href =“ https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-creator-openai-openai-is-in-is-in-talks-for-talks-for-tell-teld-for-tender-tender-offer-terfer-offer-offer-terfer-terfer-that-- &lt;/li>;

Openai在谈判中以$ 40B的回合，价格高达$ 300B的估值&lt;/a>;（D系列）。如果本回合如下所述，则A系列投资者将从5％稀释至3.2％，如下表所示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =“ https://collabfund.com/uploads/uploads/fig1_openai_round .r4.png“ alt =” fig1_openai_round.r4.png“ />; &lt; />; &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;在$ 300B的估值下，现在3.2％的股份价值$ 9.5B  - 最初5000万美元的189倍回报。还不错！&lt;/p>; &lt;H3 ID =“ Olipops-Returns”>; Olipop的回报&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>; Olipop的故事更加简单。 PitchBook在下面显示其主要资金回合：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =“ https://collabfund.com/uploads/fig2_olip2_olipop_round.round.r4.png” alt =“ fig2_olipop_round.r4.r4.png”/ >; &lt;p>; Olipop的种子投资者已从最初的28％所有权稀释到今天的大约13％。最后披露的估值是在其2022系列B期间，但此后Olipop的增长显着增长。为了估算目前的估值，我们将远期收入多倍数从公众中与预计的下一二月（NTM）收入相提并论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Olipop的收入增长非常出色，有几个消息来源表明它正在开始&lt;a href =“ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-24/olipop-soda-pitched-as-healthier-healthier-than-coke-pepsi-500亿英寸500亿英寸500亿英寸-sales“>; 2024年销售额为5亿美元&lt;/a>;，从&lt;a a href =” https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-24/olipop-soda-pitched-pitched-as-as-as-healthier -than-coke-pepsi-eyes-500亿英寸销售店>; 2023年的$ 2亿美元&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href =“ https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/09/16/16/howhowhow -Olipops-Inter-tunter-turn-100k-Into-Into-Healthier-Soda-brand.html“>; 2022年$ 7340万美元&lt;/a>;。推断这款2022-2024 CAGR，我们估计NTM收入为$ 1.3B。该预测似乎是合理的，因为收入增长几乎没有放缓的迹象，Olipop的&lt;a href =” -sales/481648？utm_source = chatgpt.com”>;扩大分销和零售业务的重要空间&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;摄氏摄氏（&lt;a href =“ https：//finance.yahoo.com/ &lt;a href =“ https://www.celsius.com/”的制造商Quote/celh/“>; celh &lt;/a>;）”>; Celsius Energy Drinks &lt;/a>;，提供了唯一的相关公共比较之一。在Olipop估计的NTM收入中，将其3.8倍的远期收入多重收入收益为$ 5.0B。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此估值下，种子投资者的13％股份价值6.39亿美元 - 令人惊叹的256倍的回报m投资，甚至超过了OpenAI系列A投资者的189x回报。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 id =“未来稀释”>;未来稀释&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然当前的估值提供了快照，但收益率在流动性。奥利普普（Olipop）不仅可能会根据当前的估值提供比OpenAI更高的回报，而且在退出之前也很可能会经历较少的稀释稀释度以及造成的回报倍数侵蚀。为了评估稀释风险，我们必须评估每种额外的资本需要多少才能达到自给自足，在这些资金始终涵盖运营和资本费用的情况下。最终，这取决于每个公司的单位经济学的实力。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 id =“ Openais-unit-unit-nit-unit-nit-unit-nit-unit-nit-unit-nit-unit-nit-nitia”>; OpenAi的单位经济学&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>; OpenAi&#39;s &lt;a href =“ https：// Futuresearch 。 >; chatgpt订阅&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; OpenAI提供多个订阅层，从有限的功能的免费计划到每月200美元的“ Pro”计划。虽然付费层产生可预测的每月收入，但推理计算成本量表与用户活动可能是不可预测的。这意味着新用户并不总是等于利润增长。最近有报道说&lt;a href =“ https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/05/openai-is-lose-money-on-on-is-pricey-pricey-pricey-chatgpt-pro-plan-ceo-ceo-sam）证明了这一挑战-Altman-Says/？Guccounter = 1“>;

 - 谁在不产生收入的情况下会产生推理费用。结果，向用户付款有效地补贴了这些费用。 2024年的推理计算成本为&lt;a href =“ https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-projections-projections-projections-imply-losses-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling-2026”>;的价格为2B美元，比较，比较估计的总收入为$ 4B &lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 id =“ api-usage”>; &lt;strong>; api用法&lt;/strong>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;模型更好地将收入与成本保持一致，但不断增长的竞争已经侵蚀了Openai的定价能力。 &lt;a href =“ https://x.com/jaminball/status/1839010466749866638”>;代币价格在短短17个月内就跌落了89％&lt;/a>;，从2023年3月4日在2023年3月4日在GPT-4发行的36美元下降到36个月$ 4到2024年8月。DeepSeek，最近证明了&lt;a href =“ https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai-ai.html”>;培训和推理可以少得多的计算密集型&lt;/a>;，只会加速这种价格崩溃。它的推理和聊天模型是&lt;a href =“ https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing”>;当前价格低于OpenAi的95％以上的价格超过95％。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;培训，虽然没有与单位经济学直接绑定，因为它没有随着使用而扩展，但仍然是一个巨大的经济负担。预计到2026年，费用预计每年达到$ 9.5B，R＆amp; d支出从2024年的1B美元攀升至2026年的$ 5B。尽管这些预测早于DeepSeek在成本效益的培训中的突破，但训练无疑将保持巨大的费用，并且本质上是费用为了维持AI领导。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下&lt;a href =“ https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-projections-imply-losses-losses-losses-tripling-tripling-tripling to-14亿美元“>;图表&lt;/a>;说明了推理和培训成本的高度，大量的自由用户和定价压力结合起来，创造了巨大的盈利能力挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =“ https：// collectfund.com/uploads/fig3_openaicosts.r1.png“ alt =” fig3_openaicosts.r1.png“/>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;培训2024的培训计算费用预计为$ 3B，推理成本增加了，增加了$ 2B。加上微软的7亿美元收入份额和大量运营费用，这些因素估计损失了2024年的$ 5B，不包括基于股票的薪酬。预计这些损失将继续下去，OpenAi投影&lt;a href =“ https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-projections-projections-imply-losses-tripling-tripling-tripling-tripling to-140亿亿美元2026年>; $ 44B从2023年到2028年的累积损失&lt;/a>;。盈利能力是2029年的目标，其收入目标为100B美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;涵盖这些巨大的损失需要连续筹集资金，最近40B回合，进一步稀释了投资者。如果Openai在2028年到2028年的预计损失的$ 44B证明是准确的，那么最新的资本输液将使它接近自给自足。但是，本轮的很大一部分是&lt;a href =“ https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/softbank-in-talks-took-invest-invest-invest-as-as-as-s-much-as-s-25b-in-openai-- report-says/“>;据报道分配&lt;/a>; &lt;/a>; openai的&lt;a href =” -Information-2025-01-23/“>; $ 19B对特朗普总统$ 500B Stargate倡议的承诺&lt;/a>;，留下了资金差距。结果，更多的资金回合和投资者稀释可能是。和既定的苏打水行业的分配成本。关键可变成本包括原料，包装，共包装费和货运，而固定成本涵盖了开销，员工，品牌营销以及R＆amp; d。与Openai不同，Olipop不需要大量的前期资本或投机R＆amp; d。尽管来自Poppi等同行的竞争。领导力/奥利波普（Olipop-Is-olipop-Is-Nearing）数十亿美元的销售/481648>; Olipop已经完全盈利&lt;/a>;。尽管该公司可能会筹集额外的资金来加速增长，但它们并不需要。这为退出提供了更灵活的途径 -  Olipop可以出售给战略买家或IPO，而无需达到复杂的多年里程碑的压力。更少的资金回合，减少稀释和有利可图的商业模式意味着，早期的Olipop投资者的暴露于延迟退出和所有权侵蚀的风险。&lt;/p>; &lt;H3 ID =“最终思想”>;最终想法&lt; /h3>; &lt;p>;这些返回强调了一个重要的课程：较少浮华的企业有时甚至超过最炒作的科技公司。这在很大程度上是由入境价的重要性驱动的 - 从250万美元的开始估值中，获得256倍的回报率要比从$ 1B的估值更可行，以及盈利能力的途径和铺平道路的单位经济学。&lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然Openai正在彻底改变行业，但Olipop悄悄地主导了其类别，证明了出色的回报并不总是来自最高的公司。对于投资者而言，要点很明确 - 入场价和时机至关重要，但是在意外的地方承认机会也很重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，全面披露 - 合作基金是Olipop的种子投资者 - 我在我之前进行的投资加入了团队。信用归我的同事们提早确定机会，甚至更多地向Olipop团队始终超出了期望。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果这使您渴望Olipop或好奇地了解更多信息，您可以检查他们&lt;a &lt;a &lt;a &lt; href =“ https://drinkolipop.com/”>;在这里&lt;/a>;。我最喜欢的口味是老式的可乐。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 31 Jan 2025 08:55:00 -0500</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/why-olipop-might-be-a-better-investment-than-openai/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/why-olipop-might-be-a-better-investment-than-openai/</guid></item><item><title>最小压力水平</title><description>&lt;p>;

&lt;em>;上帝保佑美国。&lt;/em>; &lt;/em>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您能想象今天发生？鉴于政治变得多么令人讨厌，很容易说不。但是，如果美国再次面临像9/11这样的生存危机，我认为您会看到同样的团结回归。 &lt;a href =“ https://collabfund.com/blog/common-enemies/”>;历史悠久的历史&lt;/a>;敌人在面对巨大的，破坏性的威胁时将他们的差异抛在一边。当狗屎变得真实时，人们会变得认真。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果这听起来像是一厢情愿，让我提出一个原因：当今世界如此琐碎和生气的部分原因是因为生活目前非常适合很多人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有家庭战争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失业率很低。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;家庭财富&lt;a href =“ https：//www.reuters 。 >; &lt;p>;创新令人惊讶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;它远非完美，甚至乐观主义者也可以列出数百个问题和不公正现象。一个悲观主义者会做得更糟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;，但让我这样说：随着世界的改善，我们抱怨掉落的门槛。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在没有大问题的情况下，人们会改变他们的烦恼给较小的。在没有小问题的情况下，他们专注于小问题甚至虚构的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大多数人 - 而且绝对是整个社会 - 似乎具有最小的压力。他们永远不会完全放心，因为解决了每个问题后，焦虑的目光都转移到下一个问题，无论相对于以前的问题多么微不足道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;都没有强调他们的下一顿饭会在哪里来自，担心转向政治家不礼貌。缓解战争的创伤，压力转向某人的语言是令人反感的，还是股市被高估。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;想象一个虚构的社会，具有无限的财富，无限的健康和永久的和平。他们会充满欢乐吗？可能不是。我认为他们的定义特征将是他们的不满和荒谬的。他们的女仆迟到了10分钟，他们会很生气，强调了他们的草坪是否足够绿色，或者沮丧的是他们的孩子没有进入哈佛。 a href =“ https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc8716590/”>;概念creep &lt;/a>;。这是问题的定义超出其原始边界的扩展。它通常给人的印象是，当我们改变的定义是一个问题时，世界正在越来越糟。它发生了两种方式：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;  - 先前认为正常的事情被重新定义为风险&lt;/strong>;。就像一个孩子在学校被欺负，或被诊断为精神疾病的轻度焦虑一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;  - 风险不太严重的情况是重大风险，因为主要风险&lt;/strong>; &lt;/strong>;。就像必须延迟65岁至67岁的退休一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在每种情况下，世界都会变得更好，但人们感觉不到 - 他们甚至可以感觉自己倒退了 - 因为一旦一次问题被解决了它被新的替代，通常以相同的焦虑，恐惧和愤怒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我牢记的一些事情：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;方式，进步的最佳定义&lt;/strong>;是当您淘汰了主要问题并处理较低，重度的问题时。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;压力是创新者&lt;/strong &lt;/strong >;。没有什么像忧虑那样激励，所以我们永远不应该想要一个人们将一切都视为完美的世界。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;人们是解决问题的人&lt;/strong>;。这是一个很好的特征，也是所有进步的来源。但是，当解决问题是您身份的核心时，您偶尔会看到不存在的麻烦。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;生气可能是一种令人陶醉的感觉&lt;/strong>;。它提供了一种道德上的优势感，因为当您指责他人引起问题时，您意味着自己比他们更好。感觉很棒，以一种奇怪的方式，有些人喜欢生气。&lt;/p>;

/p>; &lt;p>;，现在是逻辑响应是，&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“但是这些剃须刀的边缘不会导致紧张，摩擦和划分升高，尤其是在选举之前和之后的领导中？” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，但这是因为选择性不是免费的。实际上，它总是有成本。然而，与选择性相关的紧张和分裂几乎总是比替代方案便宜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看上去只有阿根廷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个世纪前，阿根廷是最强大，最富有的国家之一在世界上。阿根廷拥有无穷无尽的资源，多样化和识字的人口以及多元化的工业基础，为一个令人难以置信的光明未来而定位。欧洲国家已经开始大量投资，而无数的跨国公司在全国范围内开设办事处或工厂（包括制造，零售，广告，建筑和金融公司以及律师事务所）。有些人甚至宣布其首都布宜诺斯艾利斯“下一个巴黎”。一系列政府推翻了交替的民主和军事统治时期。然后，随着1940年代中期的佩隆主义的兴起，该国开始了超过75年的“一党规则”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结果？&lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿根廷从以每卡皮塔的GDP为基础来衡量的世界上世界上最富有的国家之一，到被通货膨胀袭击的国家（2023年在20％以北，超过100％以上），腐败，贫困（目前超过40％） ，还有一系列债务违约。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，这是怎么发生的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;发生了，因为阿根廷人失去了选择性。他们失去了建立改变的能力。塑造他们的命运。结果，一个人认为，一个国家将是下一个伟大的全球大国之一，而是遭受了历史性的下降。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;听起来我们今天正在目睹的事情很熟悉吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应该这样做，因为习近平删除了任期限制并在2018年灌输了自己的“终身总统”之后，中国人民被剥夺了他们的选择性（虽然中国人没有民主选举，但在XI之前的几年中，其领导人通常会响应需求/需求/ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样做，习惯似乎将中国置于与阿根廷类似的道路上，或者就此而言，俄罗斯，土耳其，伊朗和许多目前是一党或专制国家的中东国家。毫不奇怪，这些国家是腐败，不平衡的经济体以及与“西方”的差异。芬兰，荷兰，新西兰，挪威，瑞典，瑞士和英国也是最不腐败的，拥有最平衡和韧性的经济体，并且是美国最强大的盟友。毫不奇怪，这些国家历史上也拥有一些最强大的股票市场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有趣的是如何运作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实是，选择性是生活中最不被忽视的事物之一。这就是使您能够敏捷，更改过程，即时调整和自我校正的原因。这也使您能够度过困难的时刻，同时参加好人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然美国人可能会为国家的前进道路而战，有时会彼此恶化，要么在当彼此之间感到沮丧他们的候选人在获胜时输掉或激动，我们应该珍惜我们的选举，因为这意味着我们有能力（但不是义务）改变我们所处的道路。选择我们的命运。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与中国有关，只要缺乏可选性，消费者的信心就会保持沮丧（自XI删除任期限制以来已下跌了30％以上），净资本流出将继续，经济状况可能会进一步恶化，其股票市场将陷入困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;坦率地说，这就是使我现在对我感到不可投资的原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说，如果中国，恢复到一个期限限制的系统，情况可能会迅速而急剧发生变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毕竟，这正是去年在阿根廷当选自由主义者麦片后在阿根廷发生的事情。 The results so far have been astounding as Argentina has experienced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/453-javier-milei-president-of-argentina-freedom/id1434243584?i=1000677651141 “>;通货膨胀的物质下降，经济增长的绿色拍摄以及由于他的彻底变化而导致的世界领先股权&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经常是我们最感谢的事情显而易见，因为它们有成本。就我们的选举而言，成本非常值得。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:33:00 -0500</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/americas-superpower/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/americas-superpower/</guid></item><item><title>过去的信息（关于怀旧的想法）</title><description> &lt;p>;大学毕业后，我的妻子（当时是我的女友）和我在西雅图郊区的公寓。真是太神奇了 - 一个理想的位置，一个美丽的公寓，甚至可以欣赏湖景。当时的经济是如此的破坏，我们几乎没有为此付出任何钱。我们当时23岁，受雇，居住在我们的泰姬陵版本中。那是在孩子们面前，所以我们睡到周末的上午10点，去散步，早午餐，小睡了一下，出去吃晚饭。那是我们的生活。多年来，我告诉她。她说。 “You were more anxious, scared, and probably depressed then than you&#39;ve ever been.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, she was right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I think deeper than the initial knee-jerk memory, I remember being miserable. I was overwhelmed with career anxieties, terrified that I wouldn&#39;t make it, worried I was about to be fired. For good reason: I was bad at my job. I was insecure. I was nervous about relationships being fragile.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my head, today, I look back and think, “I must have been so happy then. Those were my best years.” But in reality, at the time, I was thinking, “I can&#39;t wait for these years to end.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a Russian saying about nostalgia: “The past is more unpredictable than the future.” It&#39;s so common for people&#39;s memories about a time to become disconnected from how they actually felt at the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have a theory for why this happens: When studying history, you know how the story ends, which makes it impossible to imagine what people were thinking or feeling in the past.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When thinking about our own lives, we don&#39;t remember how we actually felt in the past; We remember how we think we should have felt, given what we know today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remember myself as being happier than I was because today, looking back, I know that most of the things I was worried about never发生了。 I didn&#39;t get laid off, the career turned out fine, the relationships endured. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/overcoming-your-demons/&quot;>;slayed some demons&lt;/a>;. Even the things that were hard and didn&#39;t end up like I wanted, I got over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I know that now.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I didn&#39;t know that at the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So when I look back, I see a kid who had nothing to worry about. Even if, at the time, all I did was worry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s hard to remember how you felt when you know how the story ends.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;I was recently asked at a conference how investors should feel about the stock market given that it&#39;s basically gone straight up over the last 15 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My first thought was: you&#39;re right. If you started investing 15 years ago and checked your account for the first time, you would gasp. You&#39;ve made a fortune.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then I thought, wait a minute. &lt;em>;Straight up for the last 15 years?&lt;/em>; To echo my wife: What are you talking about?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are we going to pretend like the 22% crash in the summer of 2011 never happened?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are we supposed to forget that stocks plunged more than 20% in 2016, and again in 2018?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are we – &lt;em>;hello?&lt;/em>; – now pretending that the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression didn&#39;t happen in 2020?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That Europe&#39;s banking system nearly collapsed?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That wages were stagnant?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That America&#39;s national debt was downgraded?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are we now forgetting that at virtually every moment of the last 15 years, smart people argued that the market was overvalued, recession was near, hyperinflation was around the corner, the country was bankrupt, the numbers were manipulated, the dollar was worthless, on and on?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think we forget these things because we now know how the story ends: the stock market went up a lot. If you held on tight, none of those past events mattered. So it&#39;s easy to discount – even ignore – how they felt at the time. You think back and say, “That was so easy, money was free, the market went straight up.” Even if few people actually felt that way during the last 15 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So much of what matters in investing – this is true for a lot of things in life – is how you manage the psychology of uncertainty. The problem with looking back with hindsight is that nothing is uncertain. You think no one had anything to worry about, because most of what they were worrying about eventually came to pass.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You should have been happy and calm, given where things ended up,” you say to your past self. But your past self had no idea where things would end up. Uncertainty dictates nearly everything in the current moment, but looking back we pretend it never existed.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;My wife and I recently bought a new house. Like most of the country, it cost – let me put this mildly – a shitload more than it would have a few years ago.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We started talking about how cheap homes were in 2009. In our region they literally cost four to five times more today than they did then – plus, interest rates were low in 2009, and there was an endless supply of homes on the market to choose from. We said something to the effect of, “People were so lucky back then.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then we caught ourselves, shaking off delusion, and thinking, “Wait, do we really have nostalgia for the &lt;em>;economy of 2009&lt;/em>;?” That was literally the worst economy in 80 years. All anyone talked about was how terrible everything was. Homes were cheap because unemployment was 10% and the stock market was down 50%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back, we know 2009 was not only the bottom but the beginning of a new boom (albeit with volatility). But we didn&#39;t know that back then, and it gave us plenty to worry about that&#39;s easy to forget today. What felt like risks then now look like opportunities. What felt like dangers then now look like adventures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a similar way, Americans are still nostalgic about life in the 1950s. White picket fences, middle-class prosperity, happy families, a booming economy. There was also the ever-present risk of nuclear annihilation. Today, we know the missile was never launched. But the 5th-grader doing nuclear attack drills by ducking under her school desk? She had no idea, and had plenty to worry about that is impossible to contextualize today, since we know how the story ends. So of course she wasn&#39;t as happy as we think she should have been.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I subscribe to a few Instagram accounts devoted to 1990s nostalgia. I was a kid then, so I&#39;m a sucker for this stuff. The comments on those posts inevitably say some version of, “Those were the best years. The late &#39;90s and early 2000s was the best time to be alive.” Maybe it was pretty good. But we also had: A bad recession in 2001, a contested presidential election, 9-11 – which utterly reshaped culture – two wars, a slow economic recovery, on and on. It&#39;s easy to forget all of those because we know the economy recovered, the wars ended, and there wasn&#39;t another major terrorist attack. Everything looks certain in hindsight, but at the time uncertainty ruled the day.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Of course, things could have turned out differently. And for many people – those who &lt;em>;were&lt;/em>; laid off, or &lt;em>;did&lt;/em>; lose their home, or &lt;em>;did&lt;/em>; die in war – the happy nostalgia of remembering what life was like before might well be valid.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as Thomas Jefferson said, “How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the reason nostalgia exists is because, knowing what we do today, we often look back at the past and say, “you really didn&#39;t have much to worry about.” You adapted and moved on. Isn&#39;t that an important lesson as we look ahead?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Understanding why economic nostalgia is so powerful – why it&#39;s almost impossible to remember how uncertain things were in the past when you know how the story ends – helps explain what I think is the most important lesson in economic history, that&#39;s true for most people most of the time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The past wasn&#39;t as good as you remember. The present isn&#39;t as bad as you think. The future will be better than you anticipate.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Oct 2024 18:28:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-message-from-the-past-thoughts-on-nostalgia/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-message-from-the-past-thoughts-on-nostalgia/</guid></item><item><title> Do It Your Way</title><description> &lt;p>;The ultimate success metric is whether you get what you want out of life. But that&#39;s harder than it sounds because it&#39;s easy to try to copy someone who wants something you don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve seen this play out twice: An incredibly talented young writer with a big blog following joins a major media company where they quickly fizzled into irrelevance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was the same story each time: When the writer was young and independent they could write with their own voice, their own style, their own天赋。 They could run with their own intuition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were artists, which was what made them great.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then they joined a big media company, which said, “That&#39;s not how we do things here. Here&#39;s our style book, you must follow it to a T. And meet Gordon, he&#39;s your new editor. He will tell you what to write and when to write it. Good day, sir.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They became employees, which was their downfall.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And these were very successful media companies. They knew what kind of writing worked and what their readers wanted. But of course it didn&#39;t work out. What was right for the company was wrong for the writer. A talented person can quickly become mediocre when you force them to be someone they aren&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if you&#39;re not an entrepreneur, there&#39;s so much to learn from that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s so common to on one hand recognize how much variety there is among people – different personalities, backgrounds, goals, skills – but on the other hand ask, “What&#39;s the best way to do this thing?” as if there can be one universal answer for vastly different people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One area this impacts people is with money, where more damage is caused not by dumb financial plans but by reasonable ones that just aren&#39;t right for you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How you invest might cause me to lose sleep, and how I invest might prevent you from looking at yourself in the mirror tomorrow. Isn&#39;t that OK? Isn&#39;t it far better to just accept that we&#39;re different rather than arguing over which one of us is right or wrong? And wouldn&#39;t it be dangerous if you became persuaded to invest like me even if it&#39;s wrong for your personality and skill set?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Or take how we spend money. You like this, I like that.谁在乎？ It gets dangerous when you assume that if someone else is spending their money differently they either must be doing it better than you or doing it wrong. And that&#39;s actually very common, because it&#39;s easy to interpret someone spending money differently than you as an attack on what you&#39;ve chosen to spend money on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s possible to be humble and learn from other people while also recognizing that the best strategy for you is the one closest aligned with your unique personality and skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few things happen when you do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You do your best work and have the most fun&lt;/strong>; when you&#39;re not burdened by fear that someone else thinks you&#39;re doing it wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You measure how you&#39;re doing against your personal benchmarks&lt;/strong>;, which can both push you to your potential and prevent you from chasing someone else&#39;s.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You have a much better shot of getting what you want out of life&lt;/strong>;.

As a result, it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that McFarland grew up riding dirt bikes and stockcars, or that he eventually went into the family business as well. It also shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that he was eager to pass on the McFarland “love of wheels” to his own son.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As any parent knows, getting a young child to ride a bike is a &lt;em>;significant&lt;/em>; challenge. McFarland&#39;s experience was no different. So, like many of us, he purchased an endless number of things to help his son get riding — toddler tricycles, trainer bikes, and even a training wheel equipped motorcycle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nothing worked. More importantly, each failed to teach his son the most important part of riding a bike — learning how to balance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about it. While training wheels or a tricycle might stabilize a rider, neither allow a kid to equalize their weight on a bike.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extra wheels do all the balancing. They simply serve as a crutch.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what did McFarland do?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He decided to engineer a very different type of bike, but rather than adding something to the bike, &lt;em>;he chose to take something away&lt;/em>; — in this case the pedals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://striderbikes.com/&quot;>;Strider Bike&lt;/a>;, which enabled kids to focus exclusively on their balance and has since become one of the best-selling bikes of all-time, as well as a godsend for parents everywhere.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-09-18%20at%2010.55.36%E2%80%AFAM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 10.55.36 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few days, McFarland&#39;s son was riding the Strider Bike. Within a couple weeks, he was riding a real bike. Within a few years, his company had sold millions of bikes. In short, McFarland had solved a significant challenge with a simple (and far less expensive) solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This story is far from the only case where the best solution came from &lt;em>;using less of something rather than more&lt;/em>;. In fact, I have dealt with this dynamic personally over the past two years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;See, I grew up with eczema as a child, which I thankfully outgrew when I was about eight years old. Unfortunately, it reappeared in patches back in early 2021, so I went to see numerous doctors, dermatologists, and allergists. Each recommended a new cream, pill, and eventually a shot, which led to very mixed results. Finally it dawned on me to ask an allergist for a patch test, which is essentially a way to test to see if you are allergic to any specific chemicals that are commonly found in various soaps, shampoos, creams, and countless other products. I took the test and found out I was &lt;em>;very&lt;/em>; allergic to two of the 150 things they tested for, one of which is prevalent in something called Aquaphor, which is a Vaseline-like ointment that we had been using on my both of my sons&#39; skin.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Care to guess when we had started using it?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You guessed it, early 2021. Precisely the same time that I started having a recurrence of my eczema.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what did we do?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We removed Aquaphor from daily use in our house, I stopped taking the various medications I was using, and my skin problems have slowly improved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it applies to training wheels or skin medication, this begs the question — why are we so inclined to add things rather than take them away when searching for solutions?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer is simple — human nature and incentives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fact is, people are biased towards solving problems through addition rather than subtraction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because adding something makes you feel like you are advancing, while taking something away makes you feel like you are retreating. Couple this with the fact that most companies are incentivized to sell us endless “solutions”, and it should come as no surprise that the desire take something away is practically non-existent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We see this dynamic across all parts of the economy, and society at large.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In healthcare, nearly every condition people face is addressed by adding something. Have a skin issue? Try this cream. Having trouble sleeping? Take this pill. Can&#39;t lose weight? Take this new injectable called Ozempic (ironically a drug that aims to *take away *our appetites). Casey Means wrote extensively about this in her new book — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Energy-Surprising-Connection-Metabolism/dp/0593712641&quot;>;Good Energy&lt;/a>; — that is now #1 on the Amazon charts. In short, she makes the case that instead of jumping immediately to medications that almost always have side effects, we should instead start by identifying what is causing the problem and trying to eliminate it. For example, if you have a skin issue, start by cutting out soaps with countless active ingredients.不能睡觉？ Cut back the amount of alcohol you drink and/or TV you watch before bed. Dealing with a stomach or weight issue? Try reducing the amount of processed food and sugar you eat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In software, this concept of favoring less over more is known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot;>;Mythical Man Month&lt;/a>;” (or more simply, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law&quot;>;Brooks&#39; Law&lt;/a>;”), which was discussed at length on a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/invest-like-the-best-with-patrick-oshaughnessy/id1154105909?i=1000668134453&quot;>;podcast&lt;/a>; Patrick O&#39;Shaughnessy did with Bret Taylor (Co-Founder of Sierra, former Co-CEO of Salesforce, and a current board member at Open AI). Taylor pointed out that,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“If you want to make a software project take longer, add more people to it. This is based on the premise that when you are developing a complex system, smaller teams who complete each others&#39; sentences, each own part of the system, truly understand it, and work in unison create a magical, yet fragile, dynamic. This is the case because adding more people means more bureaucracy, which risks disempowering some of your best people and slowing things down. Just look at Healthcare.gov as a perfect example.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retail is another obvious example. Look no further than Starbucks&#39; recent troubles.主要罪魁祸首之一？ The decision to add countless options to their mobile app. In short, by designing its app to enable customers to hyper-customize their favorite drinks (according to one report there are over 170,000 ways to customize a Starbucks order), it led to orders like the one below:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-09-18%20at%2010.56.07%E2%80%AFAM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 10.56.07 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead of increasing revenues and customer retention, this hyper customization led to poor customer service, employee turnover, longer wait times, and often incorrect drink orders. Eventually, it even led to Starbucks firing its CEO and replacing him with Brian Niccol, who made a name for himself running a company that has nearly perfected the concept of “taking things away” — Chipotle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, by having far fewer options and ingredients, Chipotle created a juggernaut in the fast casual category by maximizing efficiency, throughput, and quality, which is a &lt;em>;very&lt;/em>; different business model than a company like McDonalds, which has an endless number of options on its menu and is constantly adding new ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, last year Chipotle&#39;s restaurants collectively generated more than $10 billion in annual revenues and close to $2 billion in annual operating profits (up from $900 million and $250 million respectively fifteen years ago). This model has resulted in a stock that has compounded at more than 25% annually over the past decade-and-a-half, which means that $1,000 invested in 2009 would be worth more than $40,000 today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, too many investors manage their portfolios like McDonalds or Starbucks instead of Chipotle. In an attempt to improve or upgrade them, they almost &lt;em>;always&lt;/em>; look to layer on new investments, commitments, asset classes, and securities, often shooting well past an appropriate level of complexity:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Worried about a market crash? Layer on expensive hedges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Concerned about volatility? Buy complicated options.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Want to generate higher returns in a low interest rate environment? Add leverage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trying to keep up with other investors? Chase a hot buyout or venture capital fund.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trouble is that when they do this, the more vulnerable their portfolios become. It causes them to lose track of what they own, reduces their portfolio&#39;s liquidity &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; transparency, and forces them to pay higher fees in the process. It also often leads to investors being forced to make decisions they swore they never would, typically at the worst possible moments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We saw this first hand in the lead up to, and during, the Covid crazed market of 2020-2021。 “One man band” venture capitalists were able to raise money with ease, firms like Tiger Global sprayed money in every direction with little diligence, term sheets from unknown investors landed on general partners&#39; desks, “extension funds” were waved into portfolios without even the slightest objection from limited partners, leverage was easy to come by, and investors happily traded daily liquidity for decade liquidity. Yet this is just the tip of the iceberg, as there were countless other examples of investments and structures being added to portfolios in pursuit of higher returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 2022 and 2023, this dynamic changed materially as “one man VCs” started to disappear, the Tigers of the world were humbled and retrenched, those blind term sheets stopped coming, extension funds were tabled, limited partners starting guarding liquidity with their lives, and investors more broadly started pulling in the reins as they attempted to determine what lay ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, experiences like this beg a few questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is increased complexity the path to better performance, or would investors be better off if they simply removed a few things?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should investors hold one hundred 1% positions in their portfolio (ie, be overly diversified), or should they concentrate their bets in their highest conviction positions, watch them closely, and add to them when they get dislocated?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Should investors deploy capital at a torrid pace during bull markets, or would they benefit from slowing down a bit?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer in each case is very likely an emphatic “yes” to the latter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this probably goes for most things in life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about it this way. What would happen if you reduced the number of things you focus on in your daily life by 20%? How about 30%?? Say 50%???&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the chances you wouldn&#39;t miss the things you cut out?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Would you possibly become more focused on the things you decided to keep?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Would you end up being a happier person? A better colleague? Parent? Spouse?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My guess is the answer would be a “yes” across the board here too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you might say, my life or portfolio is already &lt;em>;SO&lt;/em>; complicated, how can I possibly uncomplicate it?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My response?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just because things have gotten complicated doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t reverse it. Afterall, if Elon Musk can do it with his Raptor rocket engines, you can too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-09-18%20at%2010.56.37%E2%80%AFAM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 10.56.37 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this day and age the case can be made that we live in an era of too much. Too much information, too much stuff, too many choices, and too many distractions. As a result, there is a good chance that the path to happier lives, and yes, better portfolio performance, might start by taking things away.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:52:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/take-something-away/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/take-something-away/</guid></item><item><title> Podcast With Howard Marks</title><description> &lt;p>;I recently sat down with legendary investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We talked about investing, debt, endurance, and what really makes a difference in lifetime investment results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can check it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/behind-the-memo-the-impact-of-debt-with/id1521551570?i=1000666742345&quot;>;Apple&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ewk6BeHzcHadH5vfJvZSy&quot;>;Spotify&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea3shooJW0o&quot;>;YouTube&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Sep 2024 10:11:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/podcast-with-howard-marks/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/podcast-with-howard-marks/</guid></item><item><title> Cumulative vs. Cyclical Knowledge</title><description> &lt;p>;President James Garfield died because the best doctors in the country didn&#39;t believe in germs, probing Garfield&#39;s bullet wound after an assassination attempt with ungloved, unwashed fingers that almost certainly contributed to his fatal infection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It sounds crazy – 1881 wasn&#39;t &lt;em>;that&lt;/em>; long ago – but historian Candice Millard writes in her book &lt;em>;Destiny of the Republic&lt;/em>; how controversial germ theory was to 19th-century doctors:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;They found the notion of “invisible germs” to be ridiculous, and they refused to even consider the idea that they could be the cause of so much disease and death.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the editor of the highly respected Medical Record found more to fear than to admire in [antiseptic pioneer] Lister&#39;s theory. “Judging the future by the past,” he wrote, “we are likely to be as much ridiculed in the next century for our blind belief in the power of unseen germs as our forefathers were for their faith in the influence of spirits.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only did many American doctors not believe in germs, they took pride in the particular brand of filth that defined their profession.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They spoke fondly of the “good old surgical stink” that pervaded their hospitals and operating rooms, and they resisted making too many concessions even to basic hygiene … They believed that the thicker the layers of dried blood and pus, black and crumbling as they bent over their patients, the greater the tribute to their years of experience … They preferred, moreover, to rely on their own methods of treatment, which not infrequently involved applying a hot poultice of cow manure to an open wound.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Even a child reading this today recognizes how insane this is. And it&#39;s hardly an isolated example. Doctors used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)88719-0/fulltext&quot;>;prescribe chloroform&lt;/a>; for asthma and cigarettes for hay fever 。 They &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigthink.com/health/milk-transfusion/&quot;>;injected cow&#39;s milk&lt;/a>; into the veins of tuberculosis patients, hoping the fat would transform into white blood cells.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mercifully, we&#39;ve moved on. We believe new crazy stuff, but not &lt;em>;that&lt;/em>; crazy stuff. Everyone learned, those learnings were universally accepted and passed down the generations who are now better off because of it. Reading about medicine from 100 years ago makes you feel utterly disconnected from today&#39;s world, like you&#39;re reading about a different topic altogether.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But take something like money.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These lines were written 130 years ago by author William Dawson:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;It would seem that the anxieties of getting money only beget the more torturing anxiety of how to keep it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More lives have been spoiled by competence than by poverty; indeed, I doubt whether poverty has any effect at all upon a strong character, except as a stimulus to exertion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The thing that is least perceived about wealth is that all pleasure in money ends at the point where economy becomes unnecessary. The man who can buy anything he covets values nothing that he buys.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this, written by Earnest Hemingway in 1936:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;He remembered poor Scott Fitzgerald and his romantic awe of [the rich] … He thought they were a special glamorous race and when he found they weren&#39;t it wrecked him as much as any other thing that wrecked him.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this, written by a lawyer in 1934, taking account of the bubble preceding the Great Depression:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;In normal times the average professional man makes just a living and lives up to the limit of his income because he must dress well, etc. In times of depression he not only fails to make a living but has no surplus capital to buy bargains in stocks and real estate. I see now how very important it is for the professional man to build up a surplus in normal times. Without it he is at the mercy of the economic winds.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this, describing the 1920s Florida real estate:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;From 1919 to 1929, both forms of personal debt—mortgages and installment credit—soared. The volume of home mortgages more than tripled, and the amount of outstanding installment debt more than doubled.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Or this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/27/seneca-fat-cat-philosopher-emily-wilson-a-life&quot;>;account&lt;/a>; of Seneca, who lived 2,000 years ago:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Enemies accused him of preying on affluent elderly people in the hope of being remembered in their wills, and of “sucking the provinces dry” by lending money at a steep rate of interest to those in the distant parts of the empire.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s all so relatable. Like nothing has changed. We&#39;ve always been asking the same questions, dealing with the same problems, and falling for the same false solutions. We probably always will.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading old finance articles makes you feel like the ancient past was no different than today – the opposite feeling you get reading old medical commentary.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course there are things we knew about medicine 200 years ago that were true and things we believed about money 100 years ago that were false. But in degree there is no comparison – there&#39;s no financial equivalent of everyone denying germs only to eventually agree that it&#39;s so obviously true it&#39;s not worth debating.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some fields our knowledge is seamlessly passed down across generations. In others, it&#39;s fleeting. To paraphrase investor Jim Grant: Knowledge in some fields is cumulative. In other fields it&#39;s cyclical (at best).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are occasional periods when society learns that debt can be dangerous, greed backfires, and more money won&#39;t solve all your problems. But it quickly forgets and moves on.一次又一次。 Generation after generation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think there are a few reasons this happens, and what it means we have to accept.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Some fields have quantifiable truths, while others are guided by vague beliefs and individual circumstances&lt;/strong>;. Physicist Richard Feynman said, “Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.” Well, people do. So any topic guided by behavior – money, philosophy, relationships, etc. – can&#39;t be solved with a formula like physics and math.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Neil deGrasse Tyson says, “The good thing about science is that it&#39;s true whether or not you believe in it.” You can disagree and say science is the practice of continuous exploration and changing your mind, but in general he&#39;s right. Germ theory is true and we know it&#39;s true. But what about the proper level of savings and spending to live a good life? Or how much risk to take? Or the right investing strategy given today&#39;s economy? Those kinds of questions do not lend themselves to scientific answers. They&#39;re subjective, nuanced, and impacted by how the economy changes over time. So often there simply isn&#39;t relevant information to pass down to the next generations. Even when firm financial rules exist, some truths have to be experienced firsthand to be understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Cyclical knowledge, and the inability to fully learn from others&#39; past experiences, means you have to accept a level of volatility and fragility not found in other fields&lt;/strong>;. I can imagine a world in 50 years where things like cancer and heart disease are either non-existent or effectively controlled. I cannot ever imagine a world where economic volatility is tamed and people stop making financial decisions they eventually regret – no matter how much history of past mistakes we have to study.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 29 Aug 2024 16:55:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/cumulative-vs-cyclical-knowledge/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/cumulative-vs-cyclical-knowledge/</guid></item><item><title> A Number From Today and A Story About Tomorrow</title><description> &lt;p>;Every forecast takes a number from today and multiplies it by a story about tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investment valuations, economic outlooks, political forecasts – they all follow that formula. Something we know multiplied by a story we like.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trick when forecasting is realizing that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few weeks before he died a reporter asked Franklin Roosevelt if the Yalta Conference negotiations near the end of World War II set the stage for permanent peace in Europe.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I can answer that question if you can tell me who your descendants will be in the year 2057,” Roosevelt said 。 “We can look as far ahead as humanity believes in this sort of thing.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The deals hammered out in Yalta were the things we knew. How long they&#39;d hold, how much they&#39;d be adhered to, and what else could get in their way is just a story people told and believed in varying degrees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anything that tries to forecast what people will do next work like that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hard thing is that while the number we know today can be something real and verified, the story we multiply it by is driven by what you want to believe will happen or &lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/story/&quot;>;what makes the most sense&lt;/a>;. Forecasters get into trouble when &lt;em>;the number we know from today&lt;/em>; gives an impression that you&#39;re being objective and data-driven when &lt;em>;the story about tomorrow&lt;/em>; is so subject to opinion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When valuing a company, revenue/cash flow/profits is the number we know. The earnings multiple you attach to that figure is just a story about future growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Same with economic trends. We have lots of data, but none of it means much until you attach a story to it about what you think it means and what you think people will do with it next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That seems obvious to me. But ask forecasters if they think the majority of what they do is storytelling and you&#39;ll get blank stares.充其量。 It never seems like storytelling when you&#39;re basing a forecast in data.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And while data-driven storytelling doesn&#39;t mean guessing, it doesn&#39;t mean prophecy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We can use historical data to assume a trend will continue, but that&#39;s just a story we want to believe in a world where &lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/what-always-changes/&quot;>;things change&lt;/a>; all the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We can use data to assume a crazy event will revert to the norm, but that&#39;s also just a story in a world where unsustainable &lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/five-lessons-from-history/&quot;>;trends last longer&lt;/a>; than people think.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Few things escape that reality. BH Liddell Hart writes in the book &lt;em>;Why Don&#39;t We Learn From History?&lt;/em>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;In finance this point is made with the quip that more fiction has been written in Excel than in Word.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of this is bad. I think it&#39;s just realistic, and it means all of us should keep a few things in mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. A fact multiplied by a story always equals something less than a fact.&lt;/strong>; So almost all predictions have less than a 100% chance of coming true. That&#39;s not a bold statement, but if you embrace it it always pushes you towards room for error and the ability to endure surprise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. The most persuasive stories are what you want to believe are true or are an extension of what you&#39;ve experienced firsthand&lt;/strong>;, which is what makes forecasting so hard.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. If you&#39;re trying to figure out where something is going next, you have to understand more than its technical possibilities&lt;/strong>;. You have to understand the stories everyone tells themselves about those possibilities, because it&#39;s such a big part of the forecasting equation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4. When interest rates are low, the story side of the equation becomes more powerful&lt;/strong>;. When short-term results aren&#39;t competing for attention with interest rates, most of a company&#39;s valuation comes from what it might be able to achieve in the future. That, of course, is just a story. And people can come up with some wild stories.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 20 Aug 2024 15:40:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/numbersandstories/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/numbersandstories/</guid></item><item><title> A Few Little Ideas And Short Stories</title><description> &lt;p>;I once asked a successful author how to market a book. He waved me off and said, “If the book is good you don&#39;t need to market it. If the book is bad, no amount of marketing will help.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was exaggerating: I think his advice is like 80% true. But it&#39;s &lt;em>;definitely&lt;/em>; 80% true. And it applies to almost any product. The best marketing is a good product.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Charlie Munger once talked about how sensational Costco founder Jim Sinegal&#39;s career was.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Podcaster David Senra asked Munger: Why are there so few speeches or interviews with Sinegal?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“He was busy working,” said Munger.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most impressive people don&#39;t spend their lives on social media or managing their publicity.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Economist Russ Roberts couldn&#39;t figure out why so many World War II veterans hated the Red Cross.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Red Cross? How can you hate them? But he kept hearing it over and over again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Asked where the animosity came from, the vets kept talking about the donuts. The donuts, the donuts, the donuts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During World War II the Red Cross set up comfort stations across Europe for Allied soldiers to get a haircut, coffee, and donuts. It was free for the Americans, but British and Canadian soldiers were charged a few cents. That created a hierarchy that hurt morale, so American generals eventually asked the Red Cross to start charging the American soldiers too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly US troops – accustomed to getting free donuts – were being charged. And they hated it, viewing the Red Cross as a greedy profiteer exploiting their hunger. The grudge remained for decades after the war.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two lessons here: It&#39;s almost impossible to charge for something once you&#39;ve given it away for free, so choose your business model carefully. And people are extremely sensitive to even reasonable price changes, which is why inflation is always an emotional issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Jerry Seinfeld &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/jerry-seinfeld-gq-hype&quot;>;recently said&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Audiences are now flocking to stand-up because it&#39;s something you can&#39;t fake. It&#39;s like platform diving. You could say you&#39;re a platform diver, but in two seconds we can see if you are or you aren&#39;t. That&#39;s what people like about stand-up. They can trust it.

It showed a peculiar trend: Before the 1700s, the richest members of society had among the shortest lives – meaningfully below that of the overall population.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How could that be?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best explanation is that the rich were the only ones who could afford all the quack medicines and sham doctors who peddled hope but increased your odds of being poisoned.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would bet good money the same happens today with investing advice.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;If a petty criticism about you is obviously false, you tend not to care. If anything it just makes the person criticizing you look dumb.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the criticism could be true, you might become outraged because you know it&#39;s a genuine attack on your identity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking to Tim Ferriss, Naval Ravikant once &lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2020/10/15/naval-transcript/&quot;>;said&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;If I said, “Tim Ferriss is fat,” that would just bounce right off of you. But if I said, “Tim Ferriss and Naval are fake gurus,” that might hit us, right?&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;I thought about this when I heard an FBI interrogator say the #1 way to spot someone covering up a lie is how angry and righteous they become when defending themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;After the November, 1930 election, Republicans and Democrats held an even number of seats in the House of Representatives. A perfect tie.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time members were sworn in, thirteen had died, most of them Republicans. Special elections to replace them fell in Democrats&#39; favor, and when the Congress first met the Democrats held a comfortable majority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember this the next time you hear a confident political forecast. No one knows anything, even when it looks obvious.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;A similar story, from investor Howard Marks:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I tell my father&#39;s story of the gambler who one day hears about a race with only one horse in it, so he bet the rent money. Halfway around the track the horse jumped over the fence and ran away.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;A coach once described the rule of thirds for athletes: When training, one-third of your days should feel good, one-third should feel OK, and one-third should feel terrible. That&#39;s a good, balanced, routine. It&#39;s when you know you&#39;re pushing yourself, but not too hard. Taking risks, but not overdoing it. Have challenging goals, but not unrealistic ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think you can apply that to businesses, careers, and relationships: If it&#39;s always terrible, you&#39;re doing it wrong. If it always feels great, you&#39;re naive, oblivious, or undershooting your potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Yale economist Robert Shiller won the Nobel Prize in economics in part for his work developing a nationwide index of US housing prices dating back to the 1800s.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I once asked him: where did he find home price data from the 1800s?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The library,” he said, dryly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It&#39;s in a book by Grabler, Blank and Winnick, a National Bureau of Research volume in the early 1950s. They had a nice analysis; wonderful book. I could recommend you read it, but nobody reads it, nobody reads it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a well-known idea in real estate that you earn the highest ROI on the ugliest properties no one wants to own. The same is true for so many things in life: The unsexy work, where there&#39;s little competition, is where some of the biggest ideas are found.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;A startup founder I know was once trying to raise money from an investor. The investor told him, “I love your idea, but I think this only has a 20% chance of working.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The founder replied: “Twenty percent? Wow, you&#39;re an optimist. I think the odds are 10%, max.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was from a founder who was devoting his life to this company, with full passion and energy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jeff Bezos once &lt;a href=&quot;https://lexfridman.com/jeff-bezos-transcript/&quot;>;said&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Every startup company is unlikely to work. It&#39;s helpful to be in reality about that, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be optimistic. So you have to have this duality in your head. On the one hand, you know what the baseline statistics say about startup companies, and the other hand, you have to ignore all of that and just be 100% sure it&#39;s going to work, and you&#39;re doing both things at the same time 。 You&#39;re holding that contradiction in your head.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Before playing the Cleveland Cavaliers, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich was asked by the press how his team could stop the Cav&#39;s impressive run 。 “How do you feel your defense can get into passing lanes and stop it?” they asked.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Oh, we probably won&#39;t. I can give you some bullshit if you want,” Popovich said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We need more of this. There&#39;s a fine line between motivational cheerleading and lying.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Ronald Reagan once told this story.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were two brothers. One was a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist. The other an incurable optimist.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The parents thought both kids were so unrealistic that they talked to a psychiatrist, who came up with an idea for Christmas: Give the pessimistic boy a roomful of the most incredible toys and tell them they&#39;re all for him. Give the optimistic boy a roomful of horse manure and tell him that&#39;s all he&#39;s getting. That should cure them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The parents did it. When they checked on their boys, the pessimist with all the toys was crying. “Someone is going to take all of these away from me,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The optimistic kid with a roomful of horseshit had never been happier. He was digging frantically. “There&#39;s got to be a pony in here somewhere,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Optimists and pessimists don&#39;t respond to the information they see as much as they do an interpretation of what they want to see.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Mr. Beast – the most successful YouTube creator – said it&#39;s easier to make one video that gets 10 million views than it is to make 100 videos that get 100,000 views.为什么？ Because the best content is evergreen. It will be as relevant 10 years from now as it is today – and still getting views – which is so much more powerful than trying to get people&#39;s attention with an idea that might be relevant today but no one will care about next Tuesday.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;In his 1818 poem &lt;em>;Ozymandias&lt;/em>;, Percy Bysshe Shelley writes about coming across the rubble of a destroyed, millennia-old monument in the middle of nowhere. Nothing about the monument can be identified, except the base, with an inscription that reads:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;“My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; / Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;No one will remember you in 100 years, and it&#39;s helpful to remember that when making big life decisions.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 06 Aug 2024 13:47:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-little-ideas/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-little-ideas/</guid></item></channel></rss>
