&lt;p>;相关性不是因果关系，而且样本量很小。但是，在一个生活被很多人羡慕的群体中，在一个对幸福如此重要的话题上，一个比全国平均水平差得多的统计数据很有趣，不是吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一个致富的方式有数百万种，其中大多数涉及利用特定的利基市场和一次性机会，更不用说运气了。关于如何致富的普遍规则很难找到。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是赔钱，或者在有钱的时候失去幸福，或者成为金钱的奴隶——这些故事往往有共同点。它们非常常见，您可以将其称为法律。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;衡量财富很容易。你只要数一下就可以了。衡量财富的一些负面影响要困难得多，也更加微妙。它们是如此微妙且难以衡量，以至于许多人甚至不相信它们的存在。财富的&lt;em>;缺点&lt;/em>;？这怎么可能？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让我提出，谈论财富的负面影响是荒谬的，这也是为什么财富并不能让人们像他们想象的那样幸福的部分原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当金钱的好处如此明显，但缺点又如此微妙时，你没有预料到的缺点可能比你预期的好处更令人震惊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，我想要更多的钱。几乎每个人都这样做，尽管出于不同的原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不是一份反财富清单——只是一系列容易被忽视的微妙缺点，而且如此常见，你不妨称它们为唯一真正的法则致富。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1.生活中大部分让你快乐的事情与金钱无关，意识到一旦你有钱可能是一个痛苦的承认。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;威尔·史密斯在他的传记中写道，当他很穷的时候&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦他变得富有，这种乐观情绪就消失了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他有”郁闷直到你的梦想成真。一旦你的梦想成真，你意识到你的感觉和以前一样，你就会感到绝望。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;幸福很复杂，但如果你把它简化成一个充满爱的家庭这样的事情、健康、友谊、八小时睡眠、平衡的孩子，以及成为比你自己更大的事情的一部分，你就会意识到金钱的作用是多么有限。并不是说它没有作用；而是它没有作用。只是比你想象的要小。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样想：你愿意每年赚 10 万美元，有一个爱你的配偶、钦佩你的孩子、好朋友、身体健康、问心无愧吗？ ，或者赚了 1,000,000 美元却什么都没有？这是很明显的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，你可以贫穷而痛苦，也可以富有而快乐。但只有富人知道这种关系有多么脆弱。赚钱可能并不能改善你的婚姻，它不能让你的朋友更喜欢你，也不能让你更满足。因此，曾经对金钱可以为你做的令人安慰的乐观情绪，现在被金钱不能为你做的严酷现实所取代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有时，梦想是感觉良好的，一旦你实现了它，梦想消失了，你实际上变得沮丧。 Malcolm Forbes：当我们成功时，我们已经拥有了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2.你所认为的对自己成功的钦佩实际上可能是嫉妒。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说唱歌手德雷克曾经说过，“人们更喜欢你在为某件事而努力的时候，而不是当你拥有它的时候。”&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;很难判断这种转变何时发生，富人通常认为自己受到钦佩，但实际上却受到嫉妒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作者罗伯特·格林 (Robert Greene) 曾经写道： &lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;永远不要愚蠢地相信你通过炫耀使你超越他人的品质来激起钦佩。通过让别人意识到自己的劣势，你只会激起不愉快的钦佩或嫉妒，这会侵蚀他们，直到他们以你无法预见的方式削弱你。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;这尤其重要当你致富的原因是通过某种形式宣传你的成功，让其他人愿意帮助和支持你时，情况确实如此。当钦佩变成嫉妒时，支持就会减少，人们对你的错误的容忍度就会减少。如果一位无名记者写了一本书间接地为萨姆·班克曼-弗里德辩护，没有人会在意——他们实际上可能会祝贺作者。但自从迈克尔·刘易斯做到了，干草叉就出现了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;梭罗说，“嫉妒是所有区别都必须缴纳的税。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3。你越富有，当你犯错、疯狂、刻薄或健忘时，周围的人就越不可能告诉你。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马特·达蒙 (Matt Damon) 说，“你在社交和情感上阻碍了别人的发展。”你成名的那一刻。你对世界的体验永远不会一样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于那些变得富有的人来说，同样的情况可能也是如此，而且更为普遍。没有人会以同样的方式对待你。最糟糕的是你可能根本不知道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;艺术家达米安·赫斯特 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idler.co.uk/article/interview-damien-hirst/&quot;>;曾经说过&lt;/a>;：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;他们都爱你。银行爱你，会计师也爱你，因为他们拿走了你的钱。每年你都会有越来越多的人。一个人拿走 10%，然后另一个人拿走 10%，另一个人拿走 10%，这就是一场盛大的聚会。给你透支的人也是你最好的朋友，他们对你微笑，告诉你你很了不起，所以你就继续这样做。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;有时人们是故意利用你的，从你身上榨取一些好处。其他时候，他们不应该认真对待你。泡沫的一个大问题是财富和智慧之间的反射性关联，所以一堆疯狂的想法因为一个暂时富有的人说出来而被认真对待。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巴菲特曾经解释过：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;当我二十一岁时，我最擅长提供财务建议，但人们不听我的。我本可以站起来说出最精彩的话，但不会受到太多关注。现在可以说出世界上最愚蠢的事情，相当多的人会认为其中有一些伟大的隐藏意义或其他东西。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4。有时让你成功的是担忧和焦虑，当你富有时你就无法摆脱它。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为很多人真正想要从金钱中得到的是能够停止的能力想着钱。有了足够的钱，他们就可以不再思考这个问题，而专注于其他事情。这是一种奇怪的关系：他们沉迷于赚钱，希望有一天他们可以完全忽视它。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种痴迷是由压力和焦虑助长的。它通常表现为职业抱负、积极投资和 A 型动机。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后，一旦他们变得富有，他们就会意识到自己无法摆脱这种压力。这已经在他们的身份中根深蒂固。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们每周工作 80 小时，因为他们希望最终根本不需要工作。但是，一旦他们有足够的钱退休，他们就无法削减开支，因为他们不知道除了工作之外还能做生活中的其他事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我采访过的很多理财规划师都说：他们最大的挑战之一是让客户在退休后花钱。即使是适当的、保守的金额。节俭和储蓄成为某些人身份的重要组成部分，以至于他们永远无法改变态度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为对某些人来说这实际上很好。看着金钱复合给他们带来的快乐比花钱时更多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但那些最终目标是停止思考金钱的人却陷入了困境。拒绝承认自己已经实现了目标可能与从一开始就没有实现目标一样糟糕。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;5.管理财富和孩子没有简单的方法。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;查理·芒格的一位富有的朋友曾经问查理·芒格，给他的孩子留下一大笔钱是否会毁掉他们的动力和抱负。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; p>; &lt;p>;“当然会的，”查理说。 “但你还是必须这么做。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“为什么？”朋友问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“因为如果你不给他们钱，他们就会恨你，”查理说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就像芒格的很多建议一样，我认为这种互动旨在令人难忘。这可能有 80% 是正确的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但总的来说，他是对的。对于富人来说，这是两个选择：通过继承来毁掉他们的野心，或者冒着某种形式的冲突的风险，剥夺他们的安逸生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沃伦·巴菲特曾经说过，他经常听到富人谈论财富是多么危险。福利社会正在造就一代依赖食品券和失业救济金的食客。但他说，“这些人给他们的孩子留下了终生可用的食品券等等”。 “他们没有福利官员，而是信托基金官员。他们没有食品券，而是支付股息的股票和债券。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然也有例外。但大多数例外——继承金钱的富家子弟并不会影响他们的野心——是因为孩子很特别，而不是因为父母一定做出了明智的决定。即使18岁的比尔盖茨继承了10亿美元，也不会阻止他的野心。史蒂夫·乔布斯和埃隆·马斯克也是如此。马克·扎克伯格 (Mark Zuckerberg) 22 岁时有人向他提供 10 亿美元现金收购 Facebook，但他没有眨眼，甚至没有考虑过。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这些都是稀有鸟。大多数人都需要害怕无法成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的朋友 Chris Davis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GTpG8ePCaw&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheCompound&quot;>;在一个富裕的家庭长大&lt;/a>; - 他的祖父是传奇投资家谢尔比·戴维斯 (Shelby Davis)，他将 5 万美元变成了近 10 亿美元 - 在他年轻的时候，他被告知他不会看到其中的一分钱，因为他的家人没有想要剥夺他独立自主的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;克里斯开玩笑说：“他们本来可以剥夺我&lt;em>;一点点&lt;/em>;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是从来都不容易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;6。快速的财富是脆弱的财富。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我喜欢这样的想法：你创造财富的速度就是你失去财富的速度的半衰期。一年内你的钱翻倍？当您以同样的速度失去一半时，请不要感到惊讶。闪电式扩张？闪电战失败了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;快速而脆弱的财富会发生两件事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一是来得容易的钱往往也容易花掉。当钱来得快的时候，把钱花在无意义的事情上的情感成本就很低。只有当某件事对你来说很珍贵时，你才会小心翼翼。花掉你没有投入太多时间或精力来赚钱的快钱感觉就像是一夜情：冲动且容易后悔。老钱想要避税，新钱想要一辆兰博基尼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个是，财富创造得越​​快，运气带来的机会也就越快恢复。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;将这两者放在一起，每当你看到快速财富激增时（2021 年的加密货币就是一个很好的例子），你就知道它的结局将会很糟糕，因为运气会转化为风险，炫耀性消费会转化为不起眼的生活方式债务。&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;7.声誉具有双向动力，因为人们希望与成功者交往，避免失败者。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你越成功，就越多的人愿意与你交往 - 这很好。&lt;/p>; >; &lt;p>;但这反过来也同样有效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;职业生涯早期的人可能会搞砸，但很快就会恢复过来，进入下一家公司。一个成功的个人或公司的每一个缺陷都会在新闻中大肆宣扬，充斥着他们网络的八卦频道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雷曼兄弟 2008 年的困境成为全国新闻头条；一家小型社区银行可能已经陷入了束手无策的境地，几乎没有任何灵魂的意识。 、商贩——想与它联系在一起。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就像俗话说的，“猴子爬得越高，你就越能看到它的屁股。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;8.预期的上升速度可能快于收入的上升速度，因此较高的收入会使预期失控。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;财富是相对的。奢华是相对的。两者都只是你所拥有的和其他人所拥有的之间的比较。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我多次看到的一个怪癖是，一些最富有的人最容易出现失控的期望，因为他们变得非常了解其他富人的生活方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1907 年，作家威廉·道森 (William Dawson) 写到了财富感与你习惯的生活之间的关系：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;A一个习惯于安逸生活的受过教育的人，如果被迫住在人口稠密、肮脏的公寓的一间单间里，并不得不靠微薄而又不稳定的工资维持生计，他将遭受难以言表的折磨。他会因为那些快乐的事情的记忆而受到折磨，我们被告知这是“悲伤之冠”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，一个不知道其他生活状况的人不会意识到它的痛苦。他没有比较的标准。一个会让一个有教养的人产生自杀念头的环境，不会让他产生太多的不满。因此，穷人的幸福感比我们想象的要多得多。&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;为了阐明他的观点：道森本人相当成功，按照他那个时代的标准，他习惯于简单的手段。但道森于 1928 年去世，他一生的大部分时间都没有电或空调。他从未服用过抗生素、Advil 或脊髓灰质炎疫苗。他从来没有经历过相当准确的天气预报，也没有经历过州际高速公路。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，一个普通美国人如果回到过去体验道森的生活，将会遭受他所写的同样的“难以形容的折磨”。但他的生活没有现代可比，所以他觉得很奢侈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生活中的一切美好都只是&lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/expectations -and-reality/&quot;>;期望与现实之间的差距&lt;/a>;，当你的主要参照系是其他试图给对方留下深刻印象的富人时，这种差距很快就会缩小。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;9. 100 年后没有人会记得你。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以你不妨关注现在能让你快乐的事情，而不是未来金钱可以给你买什么。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; p>; &lt;p>;有一句苏格兰谚语：活着的时候要快乐，因为你已经死了很久了。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 11:38:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-laws-of-getting-rich/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-laws-of-getting-rich/</guid></item><item><title>大胆与鲁莽之间的一线之隔</title><description>&lt;p>;科尼利厄斯·范德比尔特刚刚完成了一系列商业交易，以扩大他的铁路帝国。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的一位商业顾问靠近告诉范德比尔特，他同意的每笔交易都违反了法律。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“天哪，约翰，”&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2DymfK7&quot;>;说&lt;/a>;范德比尔特，“你不认为你可以按照纽约州，是吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;读到这篇文章时我的第一个想法是：“这种态度就是他如此成功的原因。”在范德比尔特时代，法律并不支持铁路建设。所以他说“管它呢”，然后还是继续了。范德比尔特取得了巨大的成功，因此人们很容易把他的藐视法律的行为——这臭名昭著，但却对他的成功至关重要——视为圣人的智慧。这位斗志旺盛、有远见的人不让任何事情妨碍他！&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是这种分析有多危险？没有一个理智的人会推荐公然犯罪作为一种创业特征。你可以很容易地想象范德比尔特的故事结果会大不相同——一个不法之徒，他的年轻公司根据法院命令倒闭了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以我们这里有一个问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人们可以称赞范德比尔特藐视法律他们批评安然公司也这样做，同样充满热情。约翰·D·洛克菲勒 (John D. Rockefeller) 也有类似之处：他经常规避法律——一位法官曾称他的公司“不比普通小偷好多少”——经常被历史学家描述为狡猾的商业智慧。也许是的。但叙述何时会从“你没有让过时的法律阻碍创新”转变为“你犯了罪？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很难知道。我认为我们只能根据结果来判断过程。这是危险的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;研究企业和投资者最困难的事情是，许多推动他们成功的特质也可能很容易引发失败。但在从具体结果中学习时，我们很少会这样思考。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那些渴望向他人学习的人往往会关注尾巴。大赢家做对了什么？大输家做错了什么？通常很难从两者中找到可行的结论，因为赢家和输家经常采取类似的冒险策略，而结果却因偶然而略有倾斜。我的观点是，巨大的成功需要挑战传统智慧，但传统智慧通常是正确的并且值得遵循。我们留下的结果是，胜利者受到的赞扬超过了他们应得的，失败者受到的批评超过了他们应得的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不仅仅是违反法律。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本杰明·格雷厄姆的大多数投资成功&lt;a href=&quot;http://jasonzweig.com/was-benjamin-graham-skillful-or-lucky/&quot;>;归功于&lt;/a>;拥有 Geico 的股票。他最初的购买以及随后以高估值持有该股票，几乎打破了格雷厄姆本人在其著名著作中制定的所有规则。我们应该从中学到什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们认为马克·扎克伯格是一个天才，他拒绝了出售其公司的大要约。但人们批评 Groupon 和 Yahoo!也同样热衷于拒绝他们的大笔收购要约。这里的企业家可以吸取什么教训？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uber 在扰乱根深蒂固的出租车市场时毫不留情。但事实证明，支持一家斗志旺盛的初创公司和“#DeleteUber”之间的界限微乎其微。商学院将教授哪些案例研究？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无数的财富（和失败）都将其结果归功于杠杆作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最好（和最差）的管理者会像他们一样努力地激励员工可以。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“客户永远是对的”和“客户不知道自己想要什么”都是公认的商业智慧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“鼓舞人心的大胆”和“愚蠢的愚蠢”之间的界限“鲁莽”的厚度可能只有一毫米，只有事后才能看到。但很容易将导致成功结果的过程视为值得效仿的事情，而将导致失败的过程视为需要避免的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为我们对此无能为力。这就是其中之一。&lt;em>;就是&lt;/em>;。风险是不公平且无情的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但有一些事情值得思考。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;少关注案例研究，多关注广泛模式&lt;/strong>;。案例研究可能很危险，因为我们研究极端的例子，而考虑到极端的例子的复杂性，它们通常最不适用于其他情况。通过寻找广泛的事物模式，例如人们如何应对意外、竞争优势有多脆弱、人/企业/经济发展的速度以及什么让人们感到高兴，你将更接近于可采取行动的事情。这也是为什么&lt;a href=&quot;https://microcapclub.com/2018/01/morgan-housel-industries-teach-us-investing/&quot;>;多学科学习如此重要&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;接受策略过期的事实&lt;/strong>;。历史的讽刺之处在于，它主要是对事物变化的研究，通常被用作下一步行动的指南。唯一比低估别人的策略的风险更危险的是没有意识到整个策略只在不同的时代有效。当你接受事情会随着时间的推移而改变时，你就会对过去使用的具体策略不再感兴趣，而对广泛的主题更感兴趣，比如人们最初是如何发现这些策略的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;还有更多东西需要学习。来自那些承受风险的人，而不是那些看似征服了风险的人&lt;/strong>;。如果成功需要承担很容易变成失败的风险，而两者之间的界限几乎是实时看不见的，那么我想向那些不小心跨过界限并活下来讲述故事的人学习。从严重衰退中幸存下来的公司。从熊市中幸存下来的投资者。失败的产品经过重新设计，然后才发挥作用。在任何冒险的努力中，成功与失败之间的界限都很窄，几乎没有人能找到它，但永远不会跨过它。因此，学习如何忍受偶尔的失误并从中幸存下来，比试图完全避免它们会收获更多。这就是为什么&lt;a href=&quot;https://collabfund.com/blog/the-theory-of-maybes/&quot;>;容错空间和谦逊&lt;/a>;如此重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“什么我关心法律吗？”范德比尔特曾经说过。 “我没有这个能力吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他做到了，而且成功了。但很容易想象这些是一个结局截然不同的故事的最后一句话。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 09:07:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/the-thin-line- Between-bold-and-reckless/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/the-thin-line- Between-bold-and-reckless/</guid></item><item><title>充电、回收、重复：电池世界的可持续发展秘密</title><description>&lt;p>;电池世界正在发生一些令人惊奇的事情：由于智能行业举措和消费者意识，电池回收率一直在稳步上升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先以为我们的汽车提供动力的铅酸电池为例。据行业报告，这些电池在美国的回收率为 99%，是铝罐回收率的 2 倍。据《今日回收》报道，这使得铅汽车电池成为单一&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recyclingtoday.com/news/bci-study-claims-lead-batteries-most-recycled-consumer-product-in-united -states/&quot;>;大多数回收消费品&lt;/a>;。没错 - 每年大约收集和回收 1.6 亿个铅电池，从而避免超过 250 万吨铅和塑料堵塞垃圾填埋场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/ uploads/Fig1_RecycledProducts.r2.png&quot; alt=&quot;美国顶级回收产品图表，其中铅酸电池位居榜首，占 99%&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;情况并非总是如此。就在几十年前，只有一半的铅电池被回收。但通过电池制造商、回收商和政府之间的协调努力，基础设施和激励措施的出现使铅电池回收不仅可行，而且成为常态。这需要耐心。这需要投资。但该行业将电池回收从事后的想法转变为循环经济的光辉典范。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着我们期待未来，越来越多的锂离子电池 (LiB) 为从手机到汽车的一切设备提供动力。尽管目前的锂电池回收率低至 5-15% 左右，但铅电池的成功故事仍令人乐观。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着电动汽车在未来几十年的普及，锂电池的浪费预计将超过 20到 2040 年每年将减少 100 万吨。这似乎令人畏惧，但如果我们能够加大回收力度，这也代表着一个巨大的机遇。许多人看到废电池的浪潮，只看到一堵废物墙。但如果我们有耐心和聪明才智来开采，今天的废品堆就是明天的金矿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Fig2_BatteryRecycling.r2.png&quot; alt =&quot;全球可回收电动汽车电池供应量图表（以千吨为单位）&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回收任何复杂的产品都很困难。弄清楚物流和经济需要时间。挑战比比皆是，尤其是在收集和运输废旧电池方面。但我们有一个模板，并且有动力投资解决问题。这些电池的回收价值是巨大的。但我们以前就这样做过，企业已经在努力扩大锂电池的回收规模。这是我们对&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/news/redwood-series-d/&quot;>;我们的投资&lt;/a>;感到兴奋的原因之一：&lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.redwoodmaterials.com/&quot;>;Redwood Materials&lt;/a>; 和他们目前拥有的基础设施，用于回收电动汽车和其他类型的电池，提取有价值的材料并将其重新输入电池供应链。此次 D 轮融资超过 10 亿美元，紧随 Redwood Materials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rgj.com/story/news/money/business/2023/02/09/redwood-materials-gets -2-billion-doe-loan-for-mega-battery-facility-near-reno/69886953007/&quot;>;美国能源部提供的 20 亿美元贷款&lt;/a>;，为公司提供了充足的资金来继续投资扩大产能。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/RedwoodMaterialsFacility.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;红木材料回收设施的鸟瞰图。&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不会在一夜之间发生。我们需要建设基础设施并扩大流程。汽车制造商、电池生产商和回收商需要在复杂的价值链上进行合作。需要坚持不懈并解决问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从不起眼的铅电池中寻找灵感似乎已经过时了。您可能不会从外表上猜到，但标志性的铅电池在设计上堪称可回收性的奇迹。它的三种主要成分——铅、塑料、酸——经过精心设计，可以在闭环完美中反复回收。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不是事后的想法，而是核心原则。铅电池不会被丢弃，而是会重生。 &lt;strong>;典型的新型铅电池由 80% 的回收材料制成。没有性能损失，只是循环继续。值得注意的是，这些电池所需的铅 83% 都来自北美，而不是来自遥远的矿山。&lt;/strong>;塑料外壳也获得了新的生命。所有这些都在近乎完美的循环中循环。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几十年来，铅电池已经在全国范围内编织了一个由制造、收集地点和回收商组成的网络，&lt;strong>;超过 300,000 个地点&lt;/strong>;接受铅电池用过的电池。这是一个旨在保持铅流通的生态系统。这不是一夜之间发生的。行业团体将利益相关者聚集在一起，慢慢构建智能系统并灌输负责任的电池管理。没有炒作，只有坚持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回收的好处不仅仅是减少浪费。 &lt;strong>;生产再生铅所需的能源比开采和冶炼新铅矿石少 70%。更少的能源意味着更少的碳排放。&lt;/strong>;回收完成了循环。根据麦肯锡公司的研究，铅电池已经显示出一条前进的道路。公司希望锂电池能够走类似的道路。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;复制锂电池的铅回收管道并不简单。不幸的是，回收锂离子电池的过程本质上比回收铅电池更加棘手。铅是铅酸电池中唯一的金属，可以通过简单的工艺将其与其他电池材料分离，从而产生高纯度的铅锭。与锂离子电池相比，其中有价值的金属数量众多、种类繁多，并且存在于化学混合物中，通常需要更复杂的分离方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;铅汽车电池是回收的成功案例，但更普遍的单一电池使用碱性电池为我们的手电筒和电视遥控器供电已经走了一条不太鼓舞人心的道路。这些电池的回收率仍然很低，只有通过激励非经济行为的法规才能提高（&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878535223006020&quot;>;来源&lt;/a>;， &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/14/drawer-full-of-them-battery-recycling-waste-eu&quot;>;来源&lt;/a>;）。一个关键问题在于构成碱性电池的金属（主要是铁、锌和锰）非常便宜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于锂离子电池来说幸运的是，制造碱性电池的金属有锂、镍和钴。起来大头的材料成本是相当值钱的。再加上庞大且不断增长的锂离子电池市场，让我们希望锂离子电池回收能够大规模盈利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这一奖项和提高电动汽车可持续性目标的推动下，像 Redwood Materials 这样的初创公司正在解决以下问题：分离的技术挑战。像他们这样的工艺能够回收高达 95% 的电池材料，以降低成本进行再利用。这是从边缘拉回来的有价值的金属，以抵消昂贵的新采矿的需要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Fig3_CarbonFootprint.r2.png&quot; alt=&quot;图表显示使用回收材料的回收电池可减少 28% 的排放量”/>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回收的锂离子电池材料要从开采的矿物中夺取重要的市场份额还需要一段时间。问题在于，电动汽车的采用增长太快，新电池的需求无法与旧电池的供应相匹配——从 2021 年到 2022 年，电动汽车在全球新车购买量中所占的比例从 8.7% 增加到 14%，从 4.5% 增加到美国的 % 至 7.7%（&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer&quot;>;来源&lt;/a>;）。就问题而言，这是一件好事，而且它当然不应该阻碍锂离子电池回收领域的活动。据估计，到 2030 年，回收将能够满足约 7% 的锂需求以及 11% 的钴和镍需求（&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922003317&quot;>;来源&lt;/a>;），十年后大约是这个数字的两倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最令人兴奋的是，我们现在正接近一个临界点，即结束使用寿命的锂离子电池的数量可以证明对建筑回收的投资是合理的超级工厂。到 2025 年，我们应该有足够的可回收电池材料来制造超过 100GWh 的新型锂离子电池（来源：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assemble/our-insights/battery-回收占据主导地位>;麦肯锡&lt;/a>;）。得益于 2022 年《通货膨胀减少法案》，电池回收利用立法中名为“先进制造生产信贷”的条款得到了大力推动，该条款为国内电池制造和电池制造提供了 10 年的税收抵免。模块。根据该规定，在美国回收的电池，无论其来源如何，都有资格获得补贴。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;重要的是，这些电池材料的双流市场前景可能有利于回收商的利益。 If recyclers are able to achieve lower costs (including regulatory incentives to promote the greener practice) but they are not able to supply the entire industry, the price that they can demand may reflect the higher costs of mined material, leading to higher profits. And increasing the value of an end-of-life LIB may reduce total cost of ownership for an EV, further growing the EV market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Importantly, the monetary profit generated per ton of battery material could approach approximately $600 by as early as 2025 according to a recent McKinsey &amp;amp; Company study. Going forward, we expect the value creation potential to grow to similar levels to the primary metals industry, which is around 30 percent depending on price developments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Fig4_MonetaryValue.r1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The monetary value generated per ton of battery recycling material.&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to better recycling techniques and infrastructure, there&#39;s significant opportunities in creating new kinds of batteries that are not only optimized for particular use cases but are also longer lasting and safer. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.byterat.io/&quot;>;Byterat&lt;/a>; provides an end-to-end cloud platform for battery research and engineering. In turn this helps the industry build better, longer lasting batteries. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zitara.com/&quot;>;Zitara&lt;/a>; offers powerful battery management software to help better understand, manage, and maximize batteries. By extending battery life, we can reduce the amount of batteries entering recycling in the first place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recycling this coming wave of LiB is no small challenge. But we&#39;ve faced this crossroads before and transformed problems into progress through patient investment. If we apply those lessons, battery recycling could quietly blossom into a pillar of the circular economy, just when we need it most.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incentives align for recycling to become the norm, not the exception. But it takes vision to see value in discarded batteries and perseverance to extract it. If we maintain that mindset, LiB recycling has the potential to be a quiet triumph that supports sustainability when it&#39;s needed most. The opportunity is in our hands if we have the patience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most things that matter take patience and persistence. Battery recycling is no exception. But if we apply the mindset that transformed lead battery recycling, we can do it again for LiB and other technologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Often the most important progress goes unnoticed precisely because it becomes so widely adopted that we take it for granted. We forget how much effort went into making recycling not just viable but normal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Battery recycling likely won&#39;t make headlines. But it&#39;s a quiet triumph, and an encouraging reminder of our ability to build smart circular systems if we put our minds to it.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/recharge-recycle-repeat-the-sustainable-secret-of-the-battery-world/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/recharge-recycle-repeat-the-sustainable-secret-of-the-battery-world/</guid></item><item><title> The Tide Is Going Out</title><description> &lt;p>;Like many Americans, when I was a child, my family used to take a week-long vacation in July or August. Unlike many families, we weren&#39;t the “beach-going type”. We joke that it was because my younger brother hated the feeling of hot sand on his feet, but it was largely due to my parents wanting us to experience something different each summer. This said, three decades later, the trip that ironically gets remembered and talked about the most was the one that had the most things “go wrong”. It isn&#39;t even close.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1992, my family decided it would be fun to visit Nova Scotia. Since my brother and I had not been out of the country, my parents thought it would be a good opportunity to head north of the border. As a result, we piled into our car in early August and hit I-95 north. What followed was a trip filled with record setting heat, a massive backup on the George Washington Bridge, several missed exits, a work emergency that forced my father to fly back half way up the east coast, and a hotel that didn&#39;t have air conditioning due to the fact that this part of Canada rarely saw temperatures above the low 80s, just to name a few of the “hiccups” we encountered. However, these all paled in comparison to us almost getting trapped on an island in the middle of the Bay of Fundy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While you have likely never heard of it, the Bay of Fundy has the largest tidal range in the world with a range of 16 meters versus an average range worldwide of 3.3 meters. In a single 12-hour tidal cycle, about 100 billion tons of water flow in and out of the bay, which is &lt;em>;twice as much as the combined total flow of all the rivers of the world over the same period&lt;/em>;. As a result, at low tide you can even drive your car across its bottom to various islands. The key, however, is that you have to carefully watch the clock because if you don&#39;t get back in time, you will be stuck on the island for the night.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can see where this is going.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After my father rejoined us in Nova Scotia, he was determined to drive across the Bay of Fundy, so we headed out to explore one of the islands the next day. Despite my initial skepticism, it was actually a pretty cool experience. We saw some people walking across, while others were just hanging out in it. To our surprise, we were the only cars crossing when we did, but there were plenty of cars in the parking lot once we got to the island. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time, but this would make a lot more sense in a few short hours.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202023-09-29%20at%2010.19.57%20AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-09-29 at 10.19.57 AM.png&quot; />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After parking, we started to explore. There wasn&#39;t a ton to see near the parking lot, so we ended up straying a bit further from the car than we had planned. Eventually, my father said it was time to head back knowing that the tide was going to come back in soon. The trouble was that there weren&#39;t any cars left in the lot when we got back. They had all crossed back over. He hadn&#39;t realized that you needed to head back well in advance of the tide coming in. You couldn&#39;t just sneak back across right before the water did. Thankfully though, we made it back to our car just in time and crossed back over the Bay of Fundy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, why do I bring up the Bay of Fundy and our trip to Nova Scotia?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, I have always found it interesting that the family vacation which involved the most problems is the one that comes up most often to this day. Most importantly, we do not talk about it in a negative light. In fact, when one of us mentions it, it largely elicits laughs and positive memories – how we adjusted to the heat, how we found the best bacon cheeseburger in Canada, how our drives on the golf course were much longer given it was so firm and burned out from the lack of rain, how my mom traversed the Maine National Forest at night by herself, and of course, how we almost got stuck on an island in the middle of the Bay of Fundy. Makes you wonder, today as people endlessly “pursue perfect” — the perfect family vacation, the perfect athletic experience, the perfect house, the perfect life, are we missing the point? Instead of “searching for perfect”, should we instead be searching for unique experiences and embracing whatever this pursuit brings?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it feels like the economy might be experiencing the early stages of a “Bay of Fundy” moment. Much like the tidal cycle in Nova Scotia, which sees the tide go in and out every 12-hours, the economy has been in a very advantageous tidal period for more than 12-&lt;em>;years&lt;/em>; given how long interest rates hovered near historic lows. Yet, with the Fed having hiked rates more quickly than in any period since the early 1980&#39;s, the economic tide is clearly shifting. So far, we have just seen the earliest signs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most obvious?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The yield curve is the most inverted it&#39;s been in two decades, gasoline prices above $4 are squeezing consumers, leading economic indicators have been trending lower for 17 straight months, office occupancy is cratering as leases roll, instability in the banking sector is rising as balance sheets fall under water as a result of higher rates, credit is expensive at best and unavailable at worst, housing affordability is at an all-time low, and corporate bankruptcies are rising, just to name a few.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The less obvious?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the wake of the financial crisis fifteen years ago, congress enacted legislation to strengthen and safeguard the financial system. More specifically, in order to prevent another crisis, regulators restricted banks&#39; ability to overextend themselves again through the Dodd-Frank bill. Unsurprisingly, this caused many banks to curb lending, focus on fewer business channels, and take less risk more broadly. As is typically the case, in trying to solve the past crisis, the government may have sown the seeds for the next one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regulation simply shifted the risks to a different part of the economy. In this case, when Dodd-Frank forced most banks to pull back on lending, &lt;em>;plenty&lt;/em>; of people and/or funds stood ready to fill the gap. Unsurprisingly, this has largely come from the less regulated part of the market, namely in the form of the private markets. With rates at historic lows, these new lenders provided capital to nearly anyone who asked for it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good news?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It led to an increase in sources of capital and new business formation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bad news?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Capital inevitability funded many more businesses and opportunities than were needed, or warranted. It also led to the creation of countless funds, many of which are led by people who have never invested through a crisis. Looking ahead, this could be a problematic combination.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So where does this leave us?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I had to guess, we are likely in a similar situation to the one my family found ourselves in when we started making our way back to our car in the middle of the Bay of Fundy. In this case though, while a few cars have already left the island (see any private equity firms that raised large funds, funds that made large asset sales in 2021-2022, or companies that obtained long-term cheap debt), many more haven&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is in store for those “still on the island”? More specifically, businesses that have great concepts but are fundamentally unprofitable businesses, venture funds that deployed too much capital at high valuations, and lenders that thought rates were going to remain low forever? I suspect many will find themselves stranded without access to capital and other important resources; only instead of it being for one night, it will likely be for several years. Some will survive long enough to eventually get off the island, but many more will not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While this will likely still take time to unfold in the private markets, it appears to already be well underway in the public markets with the average small-cap stock in the Russell 2000 down more than 33% from its 52-week high.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the meantime, for those who managed to get off the island in time or passed on visiting the island altogether (ie, those who took less risk, did not get overextended, and/or have plenty of cash on hand), it might make sense to spend time trying to make a distinction between those that will eventually get off and those that will not, because when those that get off do, they will likely be available for &lt;em>;very&lt;/em>; attractive prices.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 13:14:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/the-tide-is-going-out/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/the-tide-is-going-out/</guid></item><item><title> The Written Word</title><description> &lt;p>;A few thoughts I have about writing:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Writing is an art, and art is subjective&lt;/strong>;. Novelist William Maughan said there are three rules to good writing. “Unfortunately no one knows what they are.” I actually think there&#39;s one: write the kind of stuff you like to read. Writing for yourself is fun, and it shows. Writing for others is work, and it shows.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Good writing is a performance&lt;/strong>;. Mark Twain used to read aloud his family and watch their reactions. If he saw them getting bored, he&#39;d cut that part out. If he saw them getting excited, he&#39;d double down on that section. People don&#39;t remember what you wrote as much as they remember how they felt when they read it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;A good story is like leverage for ideas&lt;/strong>;. Stories leverage ideas the same way debt leverages assets. A idea on its own might be boring, but if you tell a good story about someone interacting with that idea, you can get people to nod their heads and pay attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;People don&#39;t remember books, blogs, or articles&lt;/strong>;. They remember sentences. That should be your goal: a collection of memorable sentences. One good line is infinitely more powerful than a few clumsy paragraphs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Most good writing is a byproduct of good reading&lt;/strong>;. You&#39;ll never meet a good writer who doesn&#39;t spend most of their time reading. Not some. &lt;em>;Most&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Writing is an efficiency game&lt;/strong>;. Whoever says the most stuff in the fewest words wins.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;But efficient doesn&#39;t necessarily mean brief&lt;/strong>;. There are 900-page books where every word adds value. Efficient just means every line is a delight to read.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t try to build up to your point&lt;/strong>;. It&#39;s the biggest cause of rambling, and it&#39;s where you&#39;ll lose readers. The beginning of a story should be as pleasurable to read as the big idea that comes later.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The best books I&#39;ve read have short chapters&lt;/strong>;. Even if they are long books, they break things into quick sections that keep you moving. It keeps the author succinct and makes the reader feel like they&#39;re progressing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Big words mask little thoughts&lt;/strong>;. They&#39;re an attempt to fool the reader into thinking you&#39;re smart when you have nothing smart to say.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t overthink it. Just start writing&lt;/strong>;. Great musicians find their music in jam sessions – unstructured, no planning, just seeing what happens. I think good writing is the same. If you think about it too much, you&#39;ll be stuck. Start with one brave sentence and see where it goes.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 16:23:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/the-written-word/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/the-written-word/</guid></item><item><title> A Few Things I&#39;m Pretty Sure About</title><description> &lt;p>;You don&#39;t have to know exactly what the future holds to know that some people will handle it better than others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Money can bring happiness but it also brings complexity, and complexity can quickly lead to unhappiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s easy to mistake getting attention for being right or being admired, especially on social media.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most valuable personal finance asset is not needing to impress anyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A bigger problem than price inflation is expectations inflation: A constant increase in what you need to be satisfied.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The strongest-held beliefs are usually on topics with the most uncertainty. No one is as passionate about geometry as they are about religion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no interest in anything that&#39;s not sustainable. The key to success in so many areas of life is endurance and longevity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The proper financial mindset is to be scared enough to save for the short run and brave enough to invest for the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Projection is one of the most powerful forces, so be careful around those who tell you how honest and trustworthy they are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any amount of intelligence can be overridden by: ego, insecurity, immorality, bad incentives, or impatience, usually in that order.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a big difference between how something should work in theory vs. how it actually works in the real world, when technical facts meet human emotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People only communicate perhaps 1% of what&#39;s going through their head, so the world is probably 100x crazier and messier than it looks. Related: It is easier to spot other people&#39;s mistakes than your own, because we judge others based solely on their actions, but when judging ourselves we have an internal dialogue that justifies our mistakes and bad decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone hates a spoiled child and knows that child is socially ruined, but they themselves want easy money. Do you see the irony? Money you didn&#39;t earn or work hard for quickly becomes a social liability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The four most dangerous financial traits are: FOMO, an addiction to the appearance of certainty when none exists, impatience, and laziness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most fields have only a few laws. Lots of theories, hunches, observations, ideas, trends, and rules. But laws – things that are always true, all the time – are rare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Woodrow Wilson said government “is accountable to Darwin, not to Newton.” It&#39;s a useful idea. Everything is accountable to one of the two, and you have to know whether something adapts and changes over time or perpetually stays the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of my best work was easy to write, and the worst stuff I&#39;ve ever written was agonizing to write. I think it&#39;s similar in most fields. If an idea is good, the work flows easily. Writers&#39; block – or its equivalent in other jobs – usually means the idea is wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You only know someone well if you can correctly predict how they will react in stressful situations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s common to think that people admire you for your success, but what you might actually be fostering is envy, which will come back to haunt you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I love Brent Beshore&#39;s observation that, “I am 100% happy to watch you get really rich doing something that I have no interest in doing.” It&#39;s not always a competition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not caring about temporary things, and obsessing over permanent things, is underrated.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 14:55:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-things-im-pretty-sure-about-0923/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-things-im-pretty-sure-about-0923/</guid></item><item><title> Three Questions for Netflix Co-Founder Marc Randolph</title><description> &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marcrandolph.com/&quot;>;Marc Randolph&lt;/a>; is the co-founder and first CEO of Netflix. We recently asked him three questions about business and life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;What aren&#39;t people talking about enough?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Discussions about mental health in the workplace, including burnout, stress, and the need for a healthier work-life balance, are still not as common as they should be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And we need to start, because the situation is getting worse. Slack is constantly calling for our attention. Cell phones make us available and responsive at all hours. And the recent (and pronounced) shift to working from home has further blurred the line between work and personal time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all joke about Gen Z&#39;s insistence on “having a life” but I must confess that they have it right. I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that my most popular social media posts – by an order of magnitude - are not the ones about startup tactics, but instead are the ones about finding a better work life balance, digital sabbaths, establishing boundaries between office and home, and similar subjects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These topics matter. Endless product sprints, rivers of text messages, and dashboards full of productivity metrics all push, push, and push us to behave in unsustainable ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Something must change, and as business leaders this is on us. It&#39;s not enough to simply pay lip service to the &lt;em>;idea&lt;/em>; that balance is important. Since culture is observational, not aspirational, we need to model the behavior we want to see.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have often written about the fact that for years – including the years I was building Netflix – I left home promptly at 5:00 every Tuesday for a date night with my wife. If there was a crisis, we were going to wrap it up by 5:00. If you desperately need to talk to me, we can talk on the way to the car.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And while this behavior may have saved my sanity (and my marriage), the real benefit is that the rest of the company could see that I meant it when I told them that I expected them to carve out time for themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is this easy? No. But is it essential?是的。 Because when all is said and done, the only people who are going to remember all those nights and weekends you spent at the office are your children.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;What have you changed your mind about lately?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t get me started.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, I decided I would try to change my mind about something at least once a month – and that turned out to be way too easy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I started with politics – we are a polarized nation and I&#39;ve got plenty of opinions about why the other side&#39;s policies are so awful. But if the US is split close to 50/50 on most of these issues, I can&#39;t possibly believe that 160 million people are dead wrong. Or stupid. Or misguided.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I needed to approach my beliefs the way I did when I was debating in high school. I had to prepare myself to be able to articulate and defend a certain side of an argument, but I had to do so without knowing until right before the debate which side I would need to argue for.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more I did this, the more I realized how shallow so many of my opinions were, and that this way of thinking could not only be applied to big topics like educational reform, homelessness, gun control, immigration, environmental policies, criminal justice, and racial equality, but to smaller and equally heated topics like – to name a recent one - password sharing on Netflix. (I&#39;m not joking about the password sharing thing – It&#39;s gotten so I&#39;m scared to wade into my TikTok comments).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s been liberating, because I no longer spend my time building the case for why I&#39;m right. I now spend most of my cycles trying to figure out why they think &lt;em>;they&lt;/em>; are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has changed my perspective on almost every topic I&#39;ve looked at. But what has surprised me most about the exercise is that in almost every instance, changing my mind didn&#39;t mean flipping from one side to the other, but simply meant moving closer to the center. It meant acknowledging that these were complicated and nuanced answers that didn&#39;t have &lt;em>;any&lt;/em>; right answer. Or more frequently, would require partially unsatisfactory outcomes for both sides to agree on, accept, and move on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve still got a way to go. I&#39;m still trying to work out exactly why people are so vehemently opposed to the password sharing crackdown . 。 。 but I promise I&#39;m working on it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;What&#39;s a piece of commonly accepted advice you think is wrong?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There&#39;s no such thing as a bad idea.” That&#39;s got to be the worst advice ever. Because I&#39;ve learned that the opposite is true. &lt;em>;All&lt;/em>; ideas are bad. In fact, there&#39;s no such thing as a &lt;em>;good&lt;/em>; idea.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And it&#39;s not just wrong . 。 。 it&#39;s dangerous. Because by assuming that all ideas are good, it encourages hundreds of hours of wasted effort studying the problem, writing plans, putting together task forces, etc. – all without any feedback from the real world about whether it&#39;s actually a good idea or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our job as entrepreneurs is to take those (bad) ideas and figure out a quick, cheap and easy way to find out why they are bad. That&#39;s the only way to begin the process of testing and iteration that – if we&#39;re lucky – will eventually bring us to something that works.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can&#39;t think of a single successful company that has become successful doing their original idea. Instead, that idea was only a starting point. They took that original idea; figured out some cheap, quick, and easy way to try it; watched what happened; and then tried something else. And probably did that for years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At Netflix it took us more than 18 months, and hundreds of failed experiments to finally land on the business model that was a good idea. And they are still experimenting.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 12:21:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/three-questions-for-netflix-co-founder-marc-randolph/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/three-questions-for-netflix-co-founder-marc-randolph/</guid></item><item><title> Respect and Admiration</title><description> &lt;p>;I like the idea of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2022ltr.pdf&quot;>;reverse obituary&lt;/a>;: Write down what you want your obituary to say, then figure out how to live up to it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone&#39;s will be different, but I suspect most people would want their obituary to say: You were respected.

Someone once noted that a high-end Toyota is a better car than an entry-level BMW, because the nice Toyota is filled with things that make driving more pleasant, while the entry-level BMW is mostly just status and bragging rights. Using money to buy nice stuff is great. Fancy stuff is a different animal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This isn&#39;t universal, but there are cases when people&#39;s desire to show off fancy stuff is because it&#39;s their only, desperate, way to gain some sense of respect and admiration. They don&#39;t have any wisdom, intelligence, humor, empathy, or capacity for love to gain people&#39;s respect. So they rely on the only remaining, and least effective, lever: Look at my car, beep beep, vroom vroom.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Former football player Chad Johnson &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ShannonSharpe/status/1620223077702586370?s=20&amp;amp;t=iqXe7T24ijApj57thXkneA&quot;>;once explained&lt;/a>; why some people think he&#39;s cheap: There&#39;s no need to show off your material wealth when your name is so big that people already respect and admire you for your talents alone:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;If you can get to a point in your career where your name becomes bigger than anything you can purchase, there&#39;s your value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is nothing I can buy that is bigger than my name alone. So it made no sense [to buy jewelry]. &lt;em>;I&#39;m me&lt;/em>;. It&#39;s pointless.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;My guess is that if your favorite comedian, or actor, or athlete turned out to be broke, you wouldn&#39;t care. It wouldn&#39;t impact how much you admire them, because you admire them for talents that money can&#39;t buy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even when Amazon was huge and successful, Jeff Bezos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc0a28KrWKo&amp;amp;ab_channel=Way&quot;>;used to drive a&lt;/a>; Honda Accord. Today he has a $500 million yacht. Is he respected and admired more for it? Not in the slightest. He could ride a Huffy bike and people would consider him the greatest entrepreneur of our era, because he is. Steve Jobs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofmac.com/125861/steve-jobss-quest-for-perfection-could-make-even-buying-a-sofa-into-a-decade-long-ordeal/&quot;>;didn&#39;t have any furniture&lt;/a>;. It didn&#39;t matter. He&#39;s a genius. He&#39;s Steve Jobs. Material stuff makes no difference when you&#39;re respected and admired for internal traits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same is probably true for the people you admire most. I love and admire my parents, and let me tell you it&#39;s not because of their clothes. Isn&#39;t there so much to learn from that? Shouldn&#39;t gaining respect and admiration through what you do instead of what you own be the goal?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you see people being respected and admired for reasons that have nothing to do with the stuff they own, you begin to wonder why you have such a strong desire for those possessions. I tend to view material desire as a loose proxy for the inverse of what else you have to offer the world. The higher my desire for fancy stuff, the less real value I have to offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think if you keep it in mind, a lot of higher priorities come into view.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 12:02:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/respect-and-admiration/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/respect-and-admiration/</guid></item><item><title> Intelligent vs. Smart</title><description> &lt;p>;Here&#39;s an important distinction to make in life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people are intelligent but don&#39;t have a lick of smarts. Their ability to succeed in the world might surprise you on the downside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Others lack intelligence but gush smarts. Their potential will surprise you on the upside.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On rare occasions you meet people who are both intelligent and smart. They run laps around everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;d define intelligence vs. smart like this: Intelligent people understand technical details, smart people understand emotional details.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Or maybe:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Intelligence&lt;/strong>;: Good memory, logic, math skills, test-taking ability, rule-following.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Smart&lt;/strong>;: High degree of empathy, bullshit detection, organization, communication skills, persuasion, social awareness, understanding the consequences of your actions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both are important. But there&#39;s a critical difference in how each is valued.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Schools are good at teaching and measuring intelligence, so that&#39;s what people tend to value and aspire to. But in almost any field, smarts is what gets rewarded long term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You cannot measure empathy like you can SAT scores, so it&#39;s not surprising that one is given more weight on resumes. But who is more likely to succeed in life – a person whose main skill is memorizing formulas, or someone who can instantly relate to the emotions of coworkers, customers, spouses, and friends?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s so obvious.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And it&#39;s why the world is filled with intelligent jerks who have gone nowhere, and middling students who struggled through calculus but go on to live successful, happy lives. The most important decision most people will ever make is whether, when, and whom to marry. But that&#39;s never taught in schools – how could it be? You can&#39;t distill it down to a formula, or a one-size-fits-all answer. It&#39;s a decision that requires lots of smarts and very little intelligence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The core here is realizing that people are not spreadsheets. They are emotional, hormonal, misinformed, status-seeking, insecure creatures trying their best to make it through the day. So if you have to choose between understanding how the world &lt;em>;should&lt;/em>; work in theory vs. how it &lt;em>;actually&lt;/em>; works in practice, lean towards the latter. It&#39;s like historian Will Durant once said: “Logic is an invention of man and may be ignored by the universe.” That is so smart.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s an extreme example.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;George Soros says that whenever he sees a bubble, he rushes in to buy it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re an intelligent person, that might seem crazy. Why would you purposefully want to buy an overvalued investment?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if you&#39;re a smart person, maybe it makes sense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You know that bubbles are likely to grow larger and last longer than most people imagine. You understand what&#39;s going through people&#39;s minds, and you know investors will keep frantically buying for some time not because the numbers make sense, but because their neighbor got rich and they&#39;ll spiral down a black hole of jealousy and bad decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“That&#39;s not irrational,” says Soros. (But please don&#39;t try this; you&#39;re probably not as smart as Soros).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Derek Thompson of the Atlantic makes a beautiful point that baseball has become boring over the last 20 years.为什么？ Because every team got intelligent: they moneyballed their strategy by mining data to figure out how to get the most strikeouts. If you want to win games, that was the intelligent thing to do! But it made the game boring. It took away part of the soul, part of the fun. Now the game is in a crisis of falling interest and attendance. It took smarts to see that coming.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few other “smart” traits that are hard to measure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Accepting that people who have lived different lives than you want different things and will see the world differently. What looks like debates are often just people with different lived experiences talking over each other.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henry Ford said, “If there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person&#39;s point of view and see things from their angle as well as your own.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purely intelligent person will find this hard to grasp, because if you think there is one right answer to every problem, you insist on banging through more debate until the other side agrees with you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It takes smarts to accept that for most problems in the world, the “right” answer is the one that best promotes your individual wellbeing &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; fits your experience of how the world works. And since everyone has different needs and experiences, the only way to move forward and get things done is to tolerate and work with some views even when you disagree with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outcome, if you can pull this off, is the skill of getting along with people you disagree with. It is indispensable.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;An awareness that being nice doesn&#39;t mean being weak – it&#39;s actually a selfish strategy for gaining cooperation over time.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hedge fund Long Term Capital Management was collapsing in 1998, threatening to take down all of Wall Street in its wake.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, 14 Wall Street banks stepped in to collectively bail the fund out and halt the panic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every big bank participated in the bailout – except Bear Stearns, whose CEO Jimmy Cayne allegedly responded, “No fucking way,” to the request.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years later, Bear Stearns itself teetered on the edge. And guess how many other Wall Street banks were willing to lend Jimmy Cayne a hand?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Charlie Munger once pointed out that Benjamin Franklin didn&#39;t say honesty is the best morals – he said it&#39;s the best &lt;em>;policy&lt;/em>;. It&#39;s what&#39;s going to &lt;em>;help&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;you, and put you in the best position, earning you the most money&lt;/em>;, in the long run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a corollary there with kindness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two reasons to be kind to everyone. One is moral, the other is selfish. Morally, you should do it because you&#39;re empathetic. Selfishly, you should do it because it&#39;s easy to underestimate how many people you may eventually rely on to help you, and you&#39;ll only gain their cooperation if you remain in their good graces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Multi-disciplinary thinking&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I serve on the board of directors of Markel. Someone recently asked me what I&#39;ve learned from Markel&#39;s CEO Tom Gayner – truly one of the most accomplished investors of recent decades.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My response is that no matter what we&#39;re talking about, Tom has a perfect analogy from something totally unrelated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we&#39;re talking about insurance reserves, Tom will say something like, “You know, this reminds me of that scene from the &lt;em>;Sound of Music&lt;/em>; …”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we&#39;re talking about market valuations, Tom might say, “It&#39;s kind of like Winston Churchill used to say …”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In each case, the analogy gets right to the heart of the topic at hand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is more than mere entertaining chat. I think Tom is a good investor because he understands how the world works – connecting dots between various fields – which is so much broader than just understanding finance. People who understand finance might be intelligent, but understanding how the world works requires smarts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Too many intelligent people become siloed in their field, oblivious to how interconnected the world is.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;True independent thinking.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kevin Kelly has this great idea that you&#39;re only thinking independently if your views on certain topics can&#39;t be predicted from your views on other topics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many views can be predicted, because true independent thinking is so rare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tell me your views on immigration and I can probably guess your views on abortion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tell me who you voted for president and I can probably guess whether you think today&#39;s economy is strong or weak.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When your views on certain topics can be predicted from unrelated statements, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve outsourced part of your thinking to tribal affiliations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;True independent thinking is rare because most people would rather be comfortable than right, and there is comfort in knowing you are a good-standing member of your tribe. Thinking independently also doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re right, because the crowd is usually pretty close to accurate. Going against the tribe can also be interpreted as arrogance – suddenly you might look like Jimmy Cayne.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But poet Rudyard Kipling writes, “If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings, nor lose the common touch,” you&#39;re on your way to greatness. One way to test that is whether there are people who you agree with on some topics but not others. If there is someone whose views you agree with on every topic, be careful. If there is someone whose views you disagree with on every topic, be even more careful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think my own dog – who is such a good girl – is crazy half the time, so I shudder when people can&#39;t find any faults in their favorite politician or investing guru.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Recognizing that the best story wins.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not the best answer. Not the accurate answer. Not the answer people need to hear. The winner is just whoever gets people to pay attention and nod their heads in agreement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re merely intelligent, you might focus all of your effort on finding precise truth. If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll focus just as much effort on delivering an effective message around that truth, realizing that the most powerful truth does no good if you can&#39;t get people to pay attention to it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A doctor once told me there&#39;s a difference between an expert in medicine and an expert in healthcare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An expert in medicine knows all the right answers out of the textbook. They can diagnose with precision and are up to date on all the latest treatments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An expert in healthcare understands that medicine from the patient&#39;s view is intimidating, confusing, expensive, and time-consuming. Nothing you diagnose or prescribe matters until you&#39;ve addressed that reality with patients, because even a perfect solution makes no difference to the patient who doesn&#39;t follow it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s similar in investing. Hedge fund manager Kyle Bass summed this up well, saying: “It&#39;s easy to maintain conviction. It&#39;s harder to maintain investors.” The most successful investors tend to be expert communicators, because you have to compel your investors to stick with you during inevitable times of underperformance. Buffett. Sequoia. Even Vanguard; they are so skilled – intentionally so – at delivering an effective message beyond the numbers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Warren Buffett – amazing writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Charlie Munger – amazing writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seth Klarman – amazing writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;John Bogle – amazing writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Joel Greenblatt – amazing writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Howard Marks – amazing writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think this is a coincidence. These investors&#39; ability to write let them effectively tell their story, set expectations, and reassure investors. That made their investors more likely to stick around when times got rocky.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s hard to teach that. Storytelling is a soft, emotional skill. It&#39;s not found in intelligence. It&#39;s found in smarts.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 22 Aug 2023 12:49:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/intelligent-vs-smart/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/intelligent-vs-smart/</guid></item><item><title> A Few Stories About Big Decisions</title><description> &lt;p>;In 1964, Warren Buffett owned shares in an old industry company with fading prospects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company&#39;s CEO viewed Buffett&#39;s purchase as a threat to his job security, and offered to buy the shares back at a premium. Buffett was eager to sell, tired of watching the business struggle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two struck a deal: The company would buy all of Buffett&#39;s stock at $11 1/2 per share.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett received a letter shortly after formalizing the deal. The company would still buy all of his stock, but at $11 3/8 per share.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It really burned me up,” Buffett recalled. “You know, this guy was trying to chisel an eighth of a point from having, in effect, shaken my hand saying this was the deal.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett confronted the CEO, who argued there was never a deal to begin with. That made him even more incensed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So rather than selling, Buffett began buying as much of the stock as he could.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He eventually purchased more than a third of the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Biographer Alice Schroeder writes that, above all, Buffett&#39;s motivation for buying more of the company&#39;s stock was to stick it to the CEO who tried to screw him out of twelve cents per share.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company – Berkshire Hathaway – became Buffett&#39;s masterpiece.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;A similar story: In 1955, recent college graduate Morris Chang was offered two jobs: One at Ford for a salary of $479 a month, and one at electrical company Sylvania for $480 a month.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ford seemed like the better opportunity, but Chang asked the recruiters to match his Sylvania offer – a mere &lt;em>;$1 a month&lt;/em>; more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ford declined. So Chang took the job at Sylvania, where he learned about – and became an expert in – the growing field of transistors and microchips.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chang eventually founded Taiwan Semiconductor, which today is worth almost half a trillion dollars and produces 60% of the world&#39;s chips.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Henry Ford knew the automobile would change the world. The rest of the world wasn&#39;t so sure. In the early 1900s, cars looked like noisy toys for rich people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But toys are fun, so the one thing the public was crazy about was car racing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ford had no interest in race cars – his vision was to build a cheap, quality car for the masses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But knowing that he needed to win over both investors and the public, he built the best race car in the world, and in 1902 it beat the reigning champion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“That was my first race, and it brought advertising of the only kind that people cared to read,” Ford wrote. He became known nationwide.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The attention was enough to raise money from investors, and Ford Motor Company was formed eight months later.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything is sales.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Actress Gloria Swanson turned down a $1 million movie contract in 1927.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The studio was stunned, and asked why she balked.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I would have been the second or third person in movie history to sign a million-dollar contract, but I was the very first to turn one down,” she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That remark made headlines and helped her become even more famous, which, I assume, was the point.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s the most extreme example of the career advice, “Don&#39;t try to be the best. Be the only.”&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;As the late author Christopher Hitchens battled esophageal cancer, the brutal side effects of chemotherapy seemed like, as Dr. Peter Attia wrote, “fair trade for a few more years of useful life.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as Hitchens neared the end, he wrote:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I lay for days on end, trying in vain to postpone the moment when I would have to swallow. Every time I did swallow, a hellish tide of pain would flow up my throat, culminating in what felt like a mule kick in the small of my back. … And then I had an unprompted rogue thought: If I had been told about all this in advance, would I have opted for the treatment?&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;JFK and Jackie Kennedy didn&#39;t have a great relationship. In 1955, two years after their marriage, Jack told his father, Joe Kennedy, he wanted a divorce.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Joe responded: “You&#39;re out of your mind. You&#39;re going to be president someday. This would ruin everything. Divorce is impossible.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jack reiterated that he and Jackie weren&#39;t happy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His father shot back: “Can&#39;t you get it into your head that it&#39;s not important what you really are? The only important thing is what people think you are!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The marriage endured.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Everything is sales.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;Sugar, milk, and eggs were all rationed during World War II. Many food companies adapted to use different, often lower-quality, ingredients to get by.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;See&#39;s Candy was so obsessed with quality that it refused to lower its standards. One holiday season it closed down and put signs in its store that read, “Sold out. Buy war bonds for Christmas.”&lt;/p>; &lt;hr />; &lt;p>;America&#39;s decision to invade Northern Africa in November 1942 was extremely unpopular, even among President Roosevelt&#39;s closest advisors. By almost every account, the troops weren&#39;t ready, the planning was rushed, and the missions too ambitious. The top generals saw no downside to waiting a few more months. Dwight Eisenhower, then a general, predicted that Roosevelt&#39;s hasty order to invade would become “the blackest day in history.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The invasion worked. But looking back after the war, the president&#39;s advisors wondered why he was in such a hurry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One explanation was that the American people were antsy for something – anything – to happen after Pearl Harbor and Germany&#39;s declaration of war. Roosevelt&#39;s own son wrote him a letter saying he and his fellow soldiers were sitting around and “not having any fun … just waiting our turn.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scratching those itches may have superseded military strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;George Marshall, then Army chief of staff, said after the war: “The leader in a democracy has to keep the people entertained. That may sound like the wrong word, but it conveys the thought.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most decisions aren&#39;t made on a spreadsheet, where you just add up the numbers and a rational answer pops out. There&#39;s a human element that&#39;s hard to quantify, hard to explain, and can seem detached from the original goal, yet carries the most influence.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 12:15:00 -0400</pubDate><link/> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-stories-about-big-decisions/<guid ispermalink="true"> https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-stories-about-big-decisions/</guid></item></channel></rss>
